        "Except for braking, Meteor tops all the other segments. Evidently, RE built the J series platform for the Meteor and some smart guy in the board meeting must've said \"We have built a very strong platform here. Why not milk it to the max and build more motorcycles out of it?\". He must've received a heavy bonus that year!!! \ud83d\ude02",

Oh and in the real world I get 95 to 105 miles per gallon UK , I usually cruise 55 to 60 mph , it doesn't struggle at 70  at all but I prefer a lower cruising speed ( all the way to Cornwall from London \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude01",

Due to stiffer suspension and seating posture. \nI had booked the hunter, waited for a month, during that waiting time I test rode meteor and hunter back to back multiple times,on different roads.

Rode all three for a decent time and can definitely say i you are a daily commuter and also does highway crusing weekly or monthly go for Hunter 350. And if you are cursing regularly then go for Metor it has best stability and comfort. And of you are above 6 ft in height and want proper enfield feel then go for Clasic. \n\nBtw many people on YouTube says Hunter is not a head turner but belive me everyday many people literally stops me on Hunter asking about the bike. Its a real head turner.",

        "Miss the 500 Classic. Nothing in the 500 category now on sale with R.E. Just 350s and 650s. 500 cc Mid Range engines are missing. Enfield also needs to finally make a larger displacement bike to, such as an 8 or 900 CC model, and a 1200. They should truly take the Bullet too and develop a classic trials bike out of it. In Thailand the Bullet is not on sale.",

        "Surprising difference in 0-100 kph times - I'd have expected the Hunter and Meteor to be closer given they have the same -3.5% smaller diameter rear tire than the Classic (translating to shorter gearing) - all use the same gear ratios - on paper, the lighter Hunter should be quickest - Classic for me \ud83d\udc4c",

        "I had the Meteor as a long term bike. The electric start worked flawlessly after not using the bike for almost a month, so I don't think it's a concern. Yes, the Meteor is good for both city and highway usage but you'll have to be wary of the low rear suspension travel, which makes the bike feel a little stiff.",
        "Ride slower best fuel efficiency",
        "Hi! The efficiency in the city is better because we ride the motorcycle slowly to simulate traffic conditions. At those speeds, the torquey nature of the motor helps it pull effortlessly, which is why the city efficiency numbers are better",
        "If you are interested in Enfield, you should test ride hunter. According to your height, it will be more comfortable and lighter for you than other two models here.\n\nThough You can also try test ride on classic too, so you can get a feel decide accordingly.\nBut it's slightly heavier than hunter.",

No generalised blurb please!. At the moment I doubt the accuracy of your figures.",

        "Why the fuck would royal Enfield make the cruiser version faster than the cafe racer one??!!",
        "Hello David Higgins, \nWhat makes our test figures standardised is that our testers use the same predefined routes for city and the highway. Both routes pretty much make up for how an average Indian would go about on their commute or when touring. So, all three motorcycles in this test, or for that matter any other bike that we test at our HQ, go through the same test cycle. \n\nAs far as acceleration, braking and other performance metrics go, our testers are trained by some of the best riding schools in India. Both of them have learnt riding techniques from racing schools and have adapted them to good usage on the road, as well as bring out the best test results. \n\nSo, while our tests might be standardised, we don't generalise and give out inaccurate data. We have the files to back up our claims.",
