        "exactly 10 years back ,i bought suzuki gs150r and my brother bought pulsar150.. now he  own a suzuki gixxer.   whatever the feature be, at the end of the day suzuki is suzuki.  even the wires used is of  top class quality. Even ghost cant haunt the bike to stop you during night time.",
        "The bike is good and 250 won't compete with R15 v3 because of pricing\nI hope it does good in market\nSo as to increase competition and motivate other manufacturers too",
        "Meanwhile Honda is preparing to launch Activa 15 G VoLTE with 3 new graphics",
        "Headlamps looks like exactly burgam's. The bike looks cool",
        "amazing vehicle at 1.71 lakh\u270c\u270c",
        "Some what led lights and body works remind me of katana",
        "Is the engine of sf 250 and sf 155 bs 6 or bs 4 complaint, please let us know.",
        "Intruder bhi nikalo please 250 me or design thoda aisa rakhna jo bullet ko accha compitition desake",
        "finally changed handle bar ..........thank you....nice design",
        "Pta nhi logo ko sf250 overpriced kyu lg rhi h...v3 to nhi lgti logo ko...\nBss tore features kam he to h compare to v3.. Bhaki engine power m bahut aage hogi sf250..\n\nI think price tik h compare to cbr250.. Usme bss liquid cool engine h.. Lekin uski price bhi to jada h...\n\nAb compare to dominar, maan skte ho iske price jada h.. Lekin dominor ka mileage or city ride achi nhi h...\n\nJisko outdated look cbr250 or uncomfortable v3 or bajaj pe nhi jana chata vo ye le skte h",
        "When gixxer(naked version) will be updated?????",
        "Why don't suzuki brings the GSXR 150 to India....  Its even available in bangladesh...!",
        "Those head lamps reminds me of Suzuki burgman \ud83d\ude03",
        "Having Gixxer 2015 model run 28k kms got my engine seized up after a continuous ride for about 350kms one stretch. Dint expect that and pretty disappointed..\n\nThinking of upgradation can SF 250 perform well if rode at high speed for a long distance? Or will the engine seize ? \nIs this bike made for cruising at high speed on highways for a one stretch 400 kms?",
        "New Gixxer 2019, when it will lauch ( only gixxer) eagerly waiting for that",
        "They have made this bike by keeping in mind the Honda cbr 250 r and they have forgotten bajaj dominar... Lol",
        "Can i change the old gixxer handle bar with this new clip on handle",
        "Suzuki played really well in terms of competition, they placed the bike between Yamaha fz250 and Honda CBR 250 because the pricing difference of these two bikes was huge so now Suzuki is there as an option.",
        "is there any difference between chesses of both bikes",
        "A bike I can afford only in my dreams \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",

        "Sahi bole.. yeh kahin see bhi overpriced nehi lagti..",
        "OIL COOLED ENGINES HAVE MORE EFFICIENCY",
        "That will not be a good seller. People would prefer r15 v3 more.\nThough That generates slightly more power",
        "because it will simply kill the competition, gsxr 150 is the best 150cc but suzuki also have gixxer and gixxer sf in the same cc segment so they don't wanna launch another 150cc.",
        "than work hard for it. so it will not just a dream. all the best.",
        "@internetsurfer77\u00a0 well said, motivational",

        "Looks wise it shares some bits from the Katana.",
        "Can upgrade to bs6 in future after buying it now???",
        "The bike looks good... but the front visor is so awkwardly small and doesnt match with the wide mirrors\ud83e\udd14 a more longer and muscular visor would give it a more aggressive look\u2764\ufe0f",
        "Awesome looking bike and also very very competative price \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d",
        "I can now sense why honda is still selling the cbr250. Its a dohc, gem of an engine with wonderful riding dynamics. Its suitable for both the track and road, for touring",
        "Will they launch this in Canada?",
        "Dear this Bike with ABS or without ABS and what's price in Jaipur",
        "Your Review always sleek and informative",
        "Suzuki should have made the bike look different to the new 150 sf . It seems suzuki ran out of  design options. Its sad that the both 250 and 150 looks same.\n\nI am now awaiting the naked 250 gixxer !!! \nWho else wants a 250 cc suzuki naked ???",
        "Yammaha FZ v3 v/s suzuki Gixxer 150 (2019) which one is better to buy ??",
        "Can you video on best bikes for tall people !? I think it's contend most of the people are waiting",
        "Gixxer 250sf is expensive \nBut sales will depend upon its engine's performance",
        "Damn for 4k extra we are getting 400CC, 40BHP, DOHC, Liquid cooling, Radial calipers, USD, Better console. Dominar you are awesome. Just waiting how they will price a 400cc full fared motorcycle.",

        "Both bikes are nice and priced well. Good job Suzuki.",
        "Most informative first look \ud83d\udc4c",
        "Hope better to buy new gixxer 150 as affordable, real sports  enthusiastic can go for gixxer 250",
        "Very disappointed. \nHad shortlisted Gixxer 250, however the launched it as SF faired bike instead of naked. \n\nWas expecting DOSC engine, however we got SOHC, no USD forks, no liquid engine cooling, not sure it it has slipper clutch or not. \n\nAny way will wait for Hero XF3R which will be launching next Month. If that also disappoints, then don't have any other options will go for Dominar 2019 or will think about to wait till Feb2020 when Pulser/Dominar 250 will launch with same engine as KTM 250.",
        "Its an Japanese engine..no need to worry",
        "Utterly disappointed....they did not launched the 250 which they sell in the external market. That one was extremely beautiful.",

        "Is gixxer sf 250 have BS6??",
        "are there no naked models?",
        "Something is missing.... Graphics.... Should have been 1.29 lakh to give duke rc 125 run for the money",
        "Looks good, but the mudguard isn't necessary",
        "Awesome\nBut why the front indicators are outside???",
        "i probably wait for rs400",
        "Suzuki plz launch a naked gixer with this engine & make it light weight, currently there are only 2 bikes competing in this segment, FZ25 with big drawback of 5 speed gearbox, Duke 250 - Technologically advanced but lacks comfort & not everyone likes its looks. Not included Honda CBR 250  as it's outdated & heavily overpriced. So launch a naked version with proper pricing & you would slice a big market share, plz do it before bajaj does.",
        "Wow so desirable.  Go Suzuki \u2665\ufe0f",
        "Dominar is a 400cc bike bro....this is just 250cc... We cant compare these 2 different categories even at a price level",
        "Jin logo ko ye bike mehengi lag rahi h wo jakar bajaj or ktm ka chupa le le. Sasti milengi.",

        "Better than bmw g310r\n\nSuzuki nailed it",
        "Yamaha Fazer 25 and FZ25 are under Rs. 1.4 lakhs! I think Suzuki messed up with the price of this the SF250",
        "Any word of slipper clutch ?",
        "we have to switch electric vehicles or use public transportation",
        "Overpriced as same as Yamaha mt but head lamps looks much similar to hero xtreme 200s though even not get an liquid cooling tech but perfect and nice review \ud83d\ude0a",
        "I would like to thank bajaj for giving much more amazing bikes at even much more systematic rates even for that matter RE bikes \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc95#bajaj #Royalenfield #bikelover",
        "They should have launched R version in 250 cc",
        "Fuel tank small h isko approx 15 k aas pass hona chahiye",
        "Headlamp looks like Honda Dio's",
        "It got SUZUKI HAYABUSA DNA.",
        "Bro, Yamaha 25 has only 20 bhp and 5 speed gearbox. Also Fazer looks ugly with its bikini fairing..",
        "Yes they should have kept it under 1.5 lakh",
        "How is it overpriced? It costs the same as the Duke 250 and the Cbr250r. It makes a good choice for people who want to use it as commuter and weekend rides.",
        "Price is very high. Dominar is better choice .only 3000 more",
        "1.7 over priced I'm going with r15 v.3",
        "Burgman street + old ZMR = Front look\nYamaha fazer250 = Side look\n        Hence proved !!!",
        "It is.imspired by a hayabusa in desinging",
        "Which color is good for Gixxer sf 155cc..??????? I just going to buy coming month",
        "Put that 250cc engine in a naked gixxer and you have a bike which will sell.",
        "front end does look like a scooter",
        "Why nobody is talking about wind shield.. looks tiny and ugly. No wind blast protection. Has to be purchased.",
        "Tacky and cheap looking bike ill go for duke 250 coz its build looks better than this though duke itself got averagera build quality",
        "Still R15V3 remains The KING",
        "The 250 doesn't make sense when the fazer25 is the most vfm motorcycle in this segment...",
        "Bajaj should come out with Pulsar RS 250 which can be priced under 2 lakh on road since they could use the engine from KTM Duke 250 which would easily beat this bike",
        "Overpriced!!!\nIf it would have priced between 1.4lack to 1.5lack then definitely it was a Superhit product of Suzuki...\nRS200 or R15 v3 is still a deal breaker in terms of price...\nLittle disappointed for price",
        "250cc with 27 bhp is 1.7 lacks and r15 is 18.7 bhp for 1.3 lacks you get 8 bhp more and beautiful design on sf250. Don't compare more power with less power machine compare sf250 with KTM 200cc,250cc and cbr250.",
        "You are out of your mind.",
        "@mokujin29\u00a0 you are out of your eyes",
        "duke is very well capable of emptying ur pockets.. ;)\ninterms of reliability, ktms are not a match to suzuki..  choose wisely bro.. 250s are some big investment!",
        "Ah same complaining customers",
        "Add 3k get a 40bhp tourer #dominar",
        "I think Suzuki priced sf 250 bit high. Should be around 1.5L. Direct competition with a strong bike like Dominar will not benefit it in anyway.",
        "Bajaj dominor is best in segment \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udc4d\u270c\ufe0f",
        "Honda cbr lovers hit like here\ud83d\udc47",
        "Dominar will swallow it in one go...",
        "It not looks very impressive \ud83d\udc4e",
        "Bekar e lag rahi hai..koi khas hi nahi..",
        "I would rather buy the Dominar instead of this overpriced thing",
        "Too much plastic..this thing falls once..gameover!",
        "Definitely great choice, 2019 dominar is much improved and better.\n\nFrom interceptor 650 owner.",
        "bajaj main quality issues they use poor quality material",
        "Not everyone likes to tour, some like city rides as well, and Dominar is not good in that. Also, reliability of Bajaj is always a question mark.",
        "But it gives very less mileage bro \u2639\ufe0f but still i have to admit, the dominar 2019 is an excellent bike\u2764\ufe0f but some people prefer sports faired bikes compared to tourers so maybe they'd opt for the gixxer 250 if its a success.",
        "It will gulp gixxer easily \ud83d\ude00",
        "It is priced 20000 less than cbr 250",
        "It's competition is cbr250r and fazer 250. It lies in middle. It is not that expensive.",
        "@gyaneshupadhyaya1447\u00a0 Fazer 250 is pure crap, and CBR 250R  is extremely outdated. This is the best option unless one can increase the budget to buy the Apache RR310.",
        "Too late, underpowered and overpriced. Honda cbr250 would be a better offering in terms of Honda's reliability and ride comfort and power. \n\nI wasted my time waiting for this crap.\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9",
        "please do not buy petrol/diesel vehicles",
        "That ugly headlight design....wtf suzuki??",
        "But there is a difference the engine on this one is a sohc and that on CBR is a dohc",
        "Yes, buy bicycle. Saving money, reduce co2 gas, improve your health.",
        "So you're telling us not to purchase any vehicle?",
        "Bro it is not SOHC its SOCS\n(Suzuki Oil Cooling System)",
        "@RezaulKarim-sg7is\u00a0 hahaha...... Nice joke....",
        "@RezaulKarim-sg7is\u00a0 he is talking about the engine setup Single over head cam vs Double over head cam.",
        "Single over head system Vs double over head system.\n\nDOHC is better",
        "dohc over head system more power and refinement"
