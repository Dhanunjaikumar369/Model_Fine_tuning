        "Because India is not a third world country.... Shumi rocked.\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25",
        "If I hadn't bought a 390 Duke almost 4 years ago, I would be looking at the 390 Adventure X now. The price is reasonable. I could then approach the guys at Zedling to make me a custom kit with new front springs, dampers and the appropriate extensions to give me a total of 200 mm suspension travel up front. A monoshock upgrade would help too.\n\nOr course, this is all hypothetical. I am actually waiting for the Himalayan 450.",
        "Second hand mid model swapped with adjustable suspensions of the spoke version perfect combo in my opinion.",
        "He's just so good with his Explanation.\nHe Inspires me.",
        "Many are excited about SW wheels as if they are going to take it for hardcore off roading.. chalana road pe hi hai sabko",
        "Feels like dancing after so many requests of making this series thankyou Shumi you are awesome. All I want to know is which version should I go for If I want tubeless rims alloys will work, metzeler tubeless tyres, but adjustable suspension, also will be happy to know if electronics are really worth it? Also do you think any other bike can replace under 4lakh price range",
        "Do you mean we can fit the adjustible suspension on the KTM adv 250?",
        "Would love to hear suggestions about improving the riding posture of cruising bikes, especially Jawa STD as I own one\ud83d\ude04",
        "I'm 5 4\" and tested 390 adv v, low seat one. Could easily keep complete feet on one side. \ud83d\udc4d",
        "Is it cheaper / wiser to buy the SW and put alloys on it, or to buy the standard variant and put adjustable suspensions on it? How does it pan out?",
        "Rightly said. High time they made adjustable suspension standard for an 'adventure' model. It's not like the adv is a vfm option like Kim's used to be in the past.",
        "Any idea, why my KTM duke 390 wobbles during 120 KMPH? It\u2019s just an year old bike",
        "is KTM really have very bad suspension compared to other competitors? I am interested in KTM 390 adventure X. are there any better option in the competition?",
        "Unpopular opinion, but I have noticed throughout the years that tubeless tyres with tubes get way less punctures than tubeless tyres without tubes\ud83d\ude22. Maybe due to the added thickness of the tube, it doesn\u2019t get punctured from chip rocks especially.",
        "Is the suspension set-up different on AVD X than standard variant?\ud83e\udd14",
        "Need a video comparing it to the Duke again, whether it is worth buying it over the Duke after all these years and the changes that have been done to both the bikes.",
        "Schumi how effective is TC on a bike and particularly on 43 HP bike.  Are cornering ABS and TC are life savers on when you're about to have a bad day?",
        "I own Spoke wheel model. I normally use for touring purpose. Can I swap the Spoke wheels to Alloy wheels?",
        "How do we purchase KTM powerparts in India ?",
        "I'm booking a bike today, it has to be either the adv390 standard or the Duke 390, let me know your thoughts",
        "Good plan, TWP. Thank the lord you're not going through with it \ud83e\udd23",
        "@motorinc\u00a0 \ud83d\ude02 Haha! I know our views on the 390 Adv have some overlap so I can imagine your surprise if I did decide to go ahead with it.",
        "Oh we'd still wish you many, safe and fun rides!",
        "\ud83d\udcaf cast wheels are as good as spokes 99% of the time",
        "There's no version that as tubeless tyres and adjustable suspension. As obvious as that model is in terms of should've been there, it slipped past KTM India, clearly",
        "\u200b\u00a0@motorinc\u00a0Schumi, can't the adjustable sus be purchased from the dealer directly in the coming days for the normal and X variant? At an estimated coat of 20k?",
        "@motorinc\u00a0 i love the way spoke looks in the bike what do u suggest craving for your expert opinion..",
        "If they were tubless-spoked rims, this would be simple. But spoked wheels with tubed tyres today? They're pointless",
        "Should be, yes. KTM officially says no",
        "You should be able to, yes",
        "It'll produce the same result. Whatever works out cheaper",
        "It's not that bad, It's not plushy like Himalayan but it's well suited for highway and road ride journeys...",
        "It's not very bad. It does very little work for what it is in the process of balancing the needs of touring and off-roading. Tried to kill two birds with one stone... now the birds are both dead",
        "@Rides_with_Nihal\u00a0 thanks. i am not that much fan of off-roading. as long i can carrying heavy bags, ride very comfortably, tour long enough. it should be enough.",
        "Can be quite effective. But remember that on these low cost machines (vs KTM's bigger bikes), the systems are generally slower and older so they're more intrusive than it's possible to make them today. To us though, the suspension is such a downer that it's a bigger issue to deal with than the lack/presence of specific electronics",
        "@motorinc\u00a0 Thanks for the info\u2764\ufe0f",
        "Bro, what do u do for living? It's still a dream for me",
        "\u200b\u00a0@saranshsaha6348\u00a0stay of the internet and study simple.",
        "Duke 390 for everything except: 1/you're super tall so need the space of the adventure or 2/ you ride a lot with pillion and luggage so need the space of the adventure. We're not bringing up off-roading because you need skill to really off-road the 390A, and if you have that level of skill, you'll be able to off-road almost any bike you like",
        "@saranshsaha6348\u00a0 I started a business with my father when I was 16 and I have worked 12 hour days for the past 5 years. I'm still working to achieve my goals and have been dreaming about buying the 390 Duke for the past 2 years. Finally in the situation of buying it \u2764\ufe0f",
        "@motorinc\u00a0 that's so well put, thanks I test rode the adv for 3 hours yesterday and today going to do the same with the Duke, appreciate you\u2764\ufe0f.",
        "Full review pleaseeeee of ktm 390 sw",
        "Please do a video about royal Enfield scram.",
        "can anyone suggest me should i go for adv 250 or 390x, is it worth the extra 70-80k?",
        "Hello Shumi\u2026., please more videos on the new KTM Adv 390 X",
        "Can i buy an entry level 390 adventure and install it with adjustable suspention and spoke weels at the dealer\ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude2e",
        "Any idea on honda crf launch in India in the near future given that India is not a 3rd world country",
        "Can I get the adjustable suspension while buying a ktm 250 adv",
        "60 bucks? Which country currency is this? \nSomebody please explain",
        "New adjustable suspension fits on Adventure X?",
        "What\u2019s up with all spoke wheel tyres in the country being tube only RE , KTM .. we can buy them so what is wrong \ud83d\ude11",
        "Is adventure 250 worth for any entry level rider?",
        "I just bought adv rally today",
        "Still no Conti GT video Sir? Way too long now, no?",
        "aint the V variant the lower seat? x is tubeless?",
        "20june booked my new ktm adv 390x",
        "Kindly make shorts on Honda cb 350 Rs",
        "Something terribly wrong with product planning, I have to live with tube tyres(its 2023!) to get adjustable suspension! Or beg dealer and spend additional money for additional parts while original parts go waste.",
        "i thought offroad was Mr. K's job shumi himself knows he is not the best ofroad",
        "\u200b\u00a0@motorinc\u00a0pls soonest both X as well as SW \ud83e\udd7a",
        "Depends on what you call worth",
        "While buying? No. Add it back later? Should be possible",
        "Bucks is originally an American reference to money. We sometimes use it as a colloquial reference to money too -- INR obviously",
        "Opposite question: Can KTM dealer retrofit Alloy wheels in top of the line SW Variant ???",
        "Off-road oriented motorcycles have to have spoke wheels for better ability @alexius8111. The problem comes when India doesn't have a manufacturer for spoke wheels that seat tubeless tires. Currently, our only option is to import for what no one has clearance yet. So, it's a multi-fold issue!\n\nIf you need to get a 390 Adventure, we'd really really advise waiting, but if you have to, get the X and save up for the SW's suspensions to be retrofitted.",
        "@motorinc\u00a0cool yeah I am going to buy the interceptor soon and I was really sad that they don\u2019t come with tubeless spoke wheels , then I realised none of the motorbikes in India that have spoke wheels have tubeless tyres so I feel like am going backwards but hey am still pulling the trigger on the interceptor with hopes that after a year the market changes . Tube tyres are silly and they should be only an optional not standard fitment",
        "How would you define \"worth it?\"",
        "@motorinc\u00a0 everything we get at that price. Need it for daily use and long rides one's in a month.",
        "Congratulations Pankaj! We wish you fun and safe miles!",
        "There was some confusion when this was recorded. Not it\u2019s clear that the LS (we were told is the low seat\u2019s name) is actually the V. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nYes. Apart from the SW, all of them are tubeless.",
        "@motorinc\u00a0 Thanks guys. Im looking out for V Variant just because its tubeless and it seems to have everything SW has apart the rear suspension and spoke wheels with tube tyres. But its hard to find good reviews on it. Also, KTM will release another gen soon (next year maybe), but I didnt like the design at first \ud83d\ude2d do you think it would be a good idea buy it before they release this new one? (just considering, but still confuse bout what bike and what kind of bike to get at the moment, considering I have a pillion, and it will be for everything)",
        "If you're deciding on design from spy shots, @rocka07, you're basically misguiding yourself. We've never really recommended the current KTM Adventures anyway -- we don't like the series of compromises KTM's made to create it. We think the 2025 will be the bike that fixes most of those things. If you can wait, you should.",
        "@motorinc\u00a0 Interesting. Yeah, lets see the new one then.",
        "Ooh! Congratulations! We hope you get your bike fast!",
        "We will as soon as we can.",
        "Spot on. Lucky the 390A isn\u2019t the best off road either \ud83d\ude02",
        "Get the SW then fit the Alloy Rims onto it, problem solved.",
        "\ud83d\udc80so confusing so many variants they should just make one  perfect bike and make  premium parts which we can   replace or upgrade ...too many options too many..",
        "Convenience of having alloys massively outpowers any and all advantages of having spoke wheels!",
        "Hope these guys at KTM are listening",
        "Agreed, they should offer adjustable suspension in India too when they are offering it in Europe in base models. Dear @KTM stop being so ignorant about Indians",
        "No disrespect, 390 adventure is a really great machine. But it look neither like ADV nor like Tourer. It terms of design it still has some IDENTITY crisis",
        "I think you mistook third world country for backwardness. Third word country only means the countries that did not choose sides during the cold War. \n1st world were countries allied with USA\n2nd world countries were allied with Soviet\n3rd world countries did not took sides. \n\nPlease correct me if I am wrong.",
        "Still waiting for call from dealer for test ride to be available lol\ud83d\ude22",
        "The best reason for adjustable suspension is because most of India's roads are still 3rd world.",
        "The days of ktm bikes are gone\ud83d\ude02",
        "Please make video on RS200 \ud83d\ude04",
        "Do not know if I should laugh or be sad at \"... Cause India is not a third world country\"",
        "Bucks bol dunga, cool lagunga",
        "Feel like this bike suffered from covid 23 who is desigining such shits? Not expecting this from ktm",
        "Yeah we are no longer a third world country",
        "india is not a third world country? since when?",
        "That would increase the cost by what? How about the X with a suspension change and dump the TC, display blah blah. Motorcycling the old way!  \n\nSave money, ride more, travel more!",
        "@anichya\u00a0 Yeah that would be the wisest of all decision but what I am gonna say is ofcourse the stupidest of all decision.\n\nI really like the colour scheme of SW, I am sold just for the Orange Tubular Frame.",
        "\u200b\u00a0@zeisthegeek\u00a0likewise \ud83d\ude05. Also IMHO, spokes looks visually more chunky and gives the bike more purposeful and meaner stance",
        "@Rohitjaen\u00a0 Agree to your every letter, but the fear of puncture on a deserted road at midnight, that thing scares me. I know there are solutions like Motul Puncture Repair Solvent but still it's a big stigma. \n\nMotorinc guys can make a short regarding Tube Tyres, like are they really that big of a pain like people think it is, or if you maintain your tyre pressure and keep replacing tyres at their correct mileage then they don't get punctures and thus they are not that big of a pain.",
        "Oh we don't need a video for that. There's no reason in 2023 that anyone, outside of hardcore off-roaders (and even them, cost of spoked-tubeless rims aside), should have to remove a wheel from the bike to fix a puncture.",
        "@motorinc\u00a0 Understood Captain \ud83e\udee1",
        "There's a bit of Indian laws that prevent swappage that gets in the way, but we know what you're saying and we agree!",
        "Spoke wheels are used for off road. The design allows it to absorb shocks and impacts from rough surfaces without damage unlike alloys which would break due to their stuff design.\n\nNot important if you want a road bike but for adventure/off road bikes, spoke wheels are better.",
        "@oldbot64\u00a0 I know this and I agree, completely.  All I am saying is having the convenience of alloys is so much more better that all advantages of spoke wheels, like the one you mentioned, are completely overpowered",
        "Yes, the alloys-adj suspension model is so desperately MIA!",
        "@vardanrathi7777\u00a0 For the 390 Adventure your comment holds true as it is mostly a Duke with an inch more of suspension travel and a 19\" front wheel. For something like a Himalayan, wire spoke wheels are relevant and are more advantageous.",
        "@twowheeledparadox\u00a0 I understand. Something that's purely meant for the sole purpose of offroading - Spoke wheels are fine. Everything else, alloys!",
        "@vardanrathi7777\u00a0 Absolutely.",
        "Hi. Thank you making a request. But, making a video on the TNT 300 is difficult as there are no test bikes.",
        "@motorinc\u00a0 please atleast tell me. Is it worth buying...?   The Benelli TNT 300 is my dream bike.",
        "You might be technically accurate, but the most people will interpret it as you pointed out - backward... which is the point we were making",
        "They should able to get you a test bike soon.",
        "Good strategy! Best of luck EditorMan!",
        "Are you saying you're comfortable with KTM offering variants that suggest that we deserve less than the best possible equipment?"
