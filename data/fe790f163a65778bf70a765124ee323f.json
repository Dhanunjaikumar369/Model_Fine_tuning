        "I rode the Meteor. It is nothing like any other royal Enfields. The new REs are super refined and super easy to use. I hope they give the same upgrades to classic as well.",
        "Classic much on the standard (ergonomics) platform is so proportionate for all kind of riders. Eagerly waiting for J engine on standard.",
        "Though I don't own one ... I'm growing fan of this meteor..",
        "Don't worry bruhh I'll stick with classic",
        "I know the meteor is progress and I hope it is very successful and gets more new riders to enjoy life on two wheels. I really like Royal Enfield, the first time I rode a Bullet 500 I knew I had to have one. I bought a 2014 Classic 500 for solely pleasure riding. When I am on it I feel like I am on a time machine. Real soul and character that is extremely difficult to find these days. I know the safety of the rider is most important and all the improvements will be very helpful. I am just sad to witness the end of an era. I thank Royal Enfield for the great bikes and the workers in India who built them. May your gods watch over you and I hope all of India survives the devastating COVID pandemic.-Rick, Phoenix Arizona",

        "okay put that engine in a classic 350 and take my money",
        "Who is your editor man? Kudos to him. Give him a raise..",
        "Excellent video!  I\u2019m looking forward to seeing a 500 classic based on the new meteor\u2019s updates. Hopefully we\u2019ll be seeing these in the US soon. RE are really upping their game, and it\u2019s great to see them making inroads in world markets!",
