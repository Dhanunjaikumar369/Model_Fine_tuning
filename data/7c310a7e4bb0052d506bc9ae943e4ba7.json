        "Finally a major upgrade to classic after years. Rode the new classic and the good part is that it doesn\u2019t feels like the old vibrator classic, thanks to the new engine.",
        "I was waiting for the launch and then I had more clear picture. I booked the Meteor.\n\nThe reasons:\n1) It comes with Alloys and Tubeless Tyres by default at no additional cost. \n2) Meteor comes with Tripper Navigation on all variants. \n3) Apart from Single Channel Variant, all other variants of Classic are costlier than Meteor Fireball.",
        "1),If you ride mostly in city stop & go traffic and do occasional highway rides, then classic 350 it is. \n2),If you go for long rides on  every other weekends or ride long distance daily within city then meteor it is.",
        "Great video. Absolutely loved it. I, however, personally felt that the ride quality of Meteor was significantly better than classic. Classic is undoubtedly better when it comes to pillion comfort. Meteor trumps classic on every other aspect. I\u2019ve ridden both and this is as per my understanding. I think everybody should test ride the bikes.",

It has the weight (not meaning the kgs) but it has the feel of a tiger from it's looks. And the Red one is lethal. As of the riding comfort and ergonomics Classic is ahead. Classic is on the go for Rohan ji \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4d.\n\nHey Chief,\nIs there any chance to get Classic with the 650 twin engine in the future?\nRegards,\nDan\nPD Army",

While cornering I feel new classic 350 so..stable but one thing I feel that when we need to turn suddenly in new classic we need little hard work because... it's handle bar slightly heavier than old classic 350 and meteor too...while cornering it is stable, while u turn it's little bit hard.\n3.Seat- new classic seat is damn good wow compare to old one so comfortable.\n4.Lookwise - when compare to meteor I realised one thing wire position of new classic 350 is neatly done I mean so many wire is not visible neat and clean.\n5.Quality- I feel both are good but in new classic 350 mirror is still cheap one.\n6.Feature - for classic gear position indicator still not there \n7.Sound - honestly new classic 350 have more thump than meteor \n8.Brake- not much different ( dual ABS brake varient).\n9.Price- honestly I will say that prices of low varient of new classic is high at least give dual ABS for all.\nNew Classic 350 so refined and good performance ..nice improvement so I will say that ride position is mean key different not every person loves meteor riding position. so they can go for new classic 350\ud83d\ude42",
        "The trick is to consider all the Meteor and Classic variants together as variants of the same motorcycle and then decide which one suits you best. Personally, my choice are the Helcyon Green Classic and the Stellar Blue Meteor......now to choose between these two.........right......that's difficult............Ek ke saath ek free milega kya???",

        "Bought meteor stellar custom black on 2 September it's amazing and one important thing to remember is meteor is unique and in my opinion more comfortable especially on highways . Apart from that just take a test drive of both bikes and choose the one suitable for you that's what I did and I am satisfied with it .And guys amazing skit love this segment .",
        "While these two are more or less same, classic can be more versatile. Meteor is aggressive, fast and easy to control but it's cruiser (but has same ground clearance) and hence has certain limitations. If you go an rough patches occasionally, and highways are your playground then go and pic a meteor, but if you hit off road conditions more Classic can be a better option. But here I would like to tell you my personal experience, I took Meteor to Laddakh, and it was so easy, smooth and fun. \nBut there is on point where Classic has no match, the feel, the look, the emotion.",
        "Shumi what's ur preference if given below option\nHighness 350 n classic 350",
        "Absolutely loved the creativity with this one\ud83d\ude01\nNew Classic vs Meteor definitely is a bit of a confusing topic for new buyers...",
        "I first booked classic and then changed my mind to go with meteor.\nHandling meteor is very impressive. It has digital console inside and has gear shift indicator, which I liked very much. Handling the bike in parking slot and traffic with pillon rider is also felt very smooth.",
        "Buy wjat you feel is best for you and best in your opinion, I rode the new Classic today and there is a significant difference between this one and the UCE Classic; very little vibration relative to the UCE one, better braking, though braking could be better; more comfortable handlebar grips; levers that let lesser pressure felt on the fingers; comfortable seat foam; better suspension.\n\nIt could have had a more powerful headlight, but, I guess those who want one will go for an after market headlight anyway, same for the handlebar.\n\nNow the 500 in this form would be exceptional, technically they do have the 410/411 Himalayan Engine between the 350 and 650, but, if the 65p was a 750 the 500 would be a perfect fit in between the two. But given tue current offerings, it looks unlikely. But, think 350-500-750, with the Himalayan being a 500 instead of a 410/411.\n\nThe Meteor is more quick, but, it needs smoother roads overall, which are mainly available on only some Highways.\n\nDo you all not feel that there is a void between the 350 and the 650, and, that nit every body needs a 650, but something more like a smoother 500 single?",
        "It's Enfield's benefit either way.\nAnd now Himalayan is in the same range as well",
        "well CB350 is still the Segment best (yes it's not perfect)\nAnd it won't sell well due to less bigwing/showrooms/service centres\nmeteor and classic wins in sales",
        "@Moonlight-hq3gi\u00a0 no it's not, CB350 is more of an RE competitor rather than being an Honda the world knows.",
        "@Moonlight-hq3gi\u00a0 less bigwing showrooms and also due to how, \"in the middle\" it is. It's trying to be retro with its long stroke engine and sound, and the way it performs and it's engine specs, but doesn't look quite retro with the neo retro touches. They could have either given a liquid cooled, high compression performance oriented engine and styled it neo retro, or could have styled it completely retro and kept the current engine they're offering. But at this point, they're swinging both sides",
        "well even though cb is better\ni'am not fully satisfied with Honda India.... yeah it feels like Honda just made a RE competitor\nand it's not upto Honda Global Standards\nwish honda bring the cb150r,cb300r\ncbr250r,cbr150r...",
        "@Moonlight-hq3gi\u00a0 ikr. The cb300r is a great motorcycle because it lives up to its modern retro styling by also providing a modern engine to compliment that. That is exactly why I like the jawa 42 2.1 too. Modern retro with modern engine. The retro long stroke engine of the cb 350 seems out of place with its style language which should have been completely retro if that engine is preferred",

        "Well, I don't think there's an answer to which motorcycle is the better out of the two. But there definitely is an answer to which motorcycle is the better out of the two for a particular individual, and that largely depends on their expectations and riding requirements. \n\nIf you want something more versatile, the classic new gen is the way to go, as long as you are fine with spoke wheels and the tripper navigator being absent on most models. (Unpopular opinion but apart from the dark series, I don't like alloy wheels on any other model. They look sexy with the spokes) \n\nThe classic also has a better exhaust note, but that's only to the fussy enthusiast. For the general population, that like royal Enfields but aren't necessarily fanboys, the difference is hardly noticeable. \n\nThe meteor on the other hand is more task specific. It's better than the classic in every sense on the highways. It also is a more VFM proposition as it comes with alloys, dual channel abs and the tripper navigator in the base model itself\n\nPersonal opinion, but almost all colours of the meteor look sexy while in the classic only a select few, such as the chrome series or the halycon black look nice. \n\nAlso, meteor has fatter rear tyres if that's your thing. \n\nI think both models are good in their own ways",
