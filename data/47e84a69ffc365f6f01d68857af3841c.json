        "Dude is searching for negatives in that machine \ud83d\ude02!!",
        "How is tall gearing a problem,if you can't change gear often then simply buy a scooter, which has better after sales,soft suspension,no rusting and better rear seat comfort for your pillion.",
        "As a Cb350RS owner I can confirm that the tall gearing is a great advantage (Only if you know how to utilize it), it's a master piece.",
        "blabber what ever you want",
        "I think he was a mechanic in Honda and he got fired.",
        "These are not negative points",
        "I only agree with his last point,From the day i bought cb350rs i am in immense love with the bike no bike like rs in that segment and to mention I currently own a classic and a electra also drove them side by side to compare. I prefer the cb350rs.",
        "Lmao.. did you even ride it",
        "Okay let's talk:\n1. Availability- Yes , agree that Bigwing looks after these bikes and servicing is a bit problematic. \n2. Rusting- Every vehicle can catch a rust even premium bikes. Name one which doesn't.\n3. Fit and Finish- From the day of delivery I haven't see any issues as such on my bike till date.\n4. Tall Gear- Every bike have a nature of it's own. Shifting gear is never too exhausting and deal breaker point as the bike offers slip and assist clutch. If shifting gear being on a bike is an issue then choosing scooty as an option is wise choice.\nRear seat- Pillion dekh kar kon bike leta hai bhai. Aur batao ye log hi bolenge ki 19- 20 lakh ka bike par bhi pillion comfort nahi hai, U know which beasts I am talking about.\n5. Stiffer suspension- Better on highways and better speeds.",
        "Dude, the slipper clutch exists for a reason!\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Why are people so lazy? Gears exist for shifting! Buy a scooter or e-bike if that bugs you som much!",
        "\ud83d\ude02 Tere pass CT 100 hogi bhai exp kisi aur bike ka de raha tu",
        "Bro has 0 knowledge and knows only RE RE and RE \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",
        "Can agree with the 1st one, rest of the things summaa sollanum nu solraan \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 apdi paatha RE ku laam adukikite polaam\ud83d\ude05",
        "Tall gearing is the only reason I brought the highness after test ride\u2026  The tall gearing gives the bike a different character from all other bikes.",
        "All the points mentioned regarding mechanicals are actually a plus. This are things that we have been trying to improve in RE and other bikes for a long time.",
        "Bhai availablity kuch nahi h hamare kota mai normal honda ka bhi showroom h or bigwing ka bhi ha....mai normal honda ke showroom me bhi gaya tha waha bhi ye bike available h.....or long gearing kahi se bhi dikkat nahi me khud chalata hu city me 2nd gear me bilkul 5 ki speed se bhi utha sakte h ... suspension jitna hona chahiye utna h",
        "Short gearing wala koi bike batao dominar 250 mein v same problem hai traffic mein bar bar gear change karna padta hai.",
        "Any issues on the heart of this bike...i mean engine side?..the answer will never ever. THATS HONDA BHAAI.... chalake dekho",
        "I think he's ready to even tell that RE has better fit and finish \ud83d\ude02",
        "Chill man RE owners \u2615\u2615. Can't help them \ud83d\ude02",
        "Was waiting for your permission, ab to toofaan laa denge",
        "@Torqueifyt\u00a0 permission granted sathitu poi ukkaru",
        "We own its sibling, The Hness cb350 since 2 years, LMAO",
        "Isko CB350 RS ki jagah koi or bike dikha di shayad\ud83d\ude03",
        "True. I have owned the RS for 3 months now, absolute beast and smoothness redefined. I still enjoy riding it like the first day. Ps. I love the suspension",
        "Light issue bol skta to man jata \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05",
        "Thank you for this comment. I hope this guy evaluates things in a better way before making another video.",
        "@divitchaudhary7765\u00a0 Yes, hope so Bro..",
        "What is the solution for tall gearing then? You buy a 10k rupee shoes and use toe shifter all the time and buy new shoes every month? Why these idiots not offer proper heel and toe shifters?",
        "@manoharmeka999\u00a0 bro to be honest I personally prefer toe shifter rather than heel setup as for me it gives the aesthetics of sporty character.. And while riding I use leather boots which looks good even dirty\ud83d\ude05",
        "@StallionsAndTales\u00a0 tell me honestly how others feel about you looking pressed, folded left shoe looks compared to other one. Even in black and white days, it would look odd on screen.",
        "@manoharmeka999\u00a0For heal and toe shifter one can consider cb350 h'ness",
        "Bhai kya sirf Honda bigwing se hii Lee sakte hai kya RS  ko yaaa normal Honda showroom main bhi advance dee k liya Jaa sakta hai \ud83d\ude05 please koi thoda ideas deee doo",

        "Check our previous videos pata lag jayega",
        "Royal enfields have short gearing setup and the newly launched honda CB350 also has shorter gearing setup",
        "We own a hness brother and its our favourite in the lot",
        "What color is your CB350RS ?",
        "Just wanted to see content of cons of Classic 350. Have you made one ???",
        "These are the reasons to NOT buy the bike, if it matters to you. Simple as that!\n\nIf none of these reasons matter, you can go ahead and buy it. If you feel these are irrelevant, then thats exactly the point of this video - to point out that the bike has only few negatives.\n\nThese videos are for everyone, so it is a good thing that he is analyzing all aspects.",
        "Mera state mai big wing hai nhi \ud83d\ude22",

        "Brother I don\u2019t agree with you \nAll points can be seen by you but I couldn\u2019t find any of these in my bike",
        "I live in Delhi and there are 2 big wing showrooms here within 30km and 3 showrooms within 50-70 km. So i don't think there will be any problem.",
        "Extremely poor research. Appears doesn\u2019t have knowledge on machines and their working and purpose. Further how can one only cover cons\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. Has he forgotten Engine refinement, slipper clutch, traction control etc etc.",
        "Bhai this is common.. ab iske like bike chhodh de",
        "Stiffer suspension good for bumpy roads, at least you have to learn prior to spread negatives. And worthless opinions .. tall gearing shouldn\u2019t be a problem once you used it it\u2019s awesome\u2026",
        "Bhai give the review after using the bike for sometime",
        "Ye point no 3 me kya bole aap ki tall gearing setup me jaldi jaldi gear change karne padte hain traffic me   kahan se bike chalana seekhi aapne bhai Hum logo ko bhi batao hum wahan kabhi nahi jaaenge",

        "@Torqueifyt\u00a0 People with multiple Big Wing stores nearby are laughing at what you said. That's senseless. \n\nYou were quite polite in the way you pointed out the negatives. I don't think you were hating on the bike. \n\nFor me, suspension, rusting and availability won't be problematic, but tall gears might be. For some other buyer, the problems will be different.",
        "That\u2019s exactly what we wanted to project from this video, We loved that you got our point",
        "Aap comedy show me try kro, acha chance h aapka",

        "@Torqueifyt\u00a0 if I have to choose between highness and new Honda cb 350 which one is good",
        "Opinion is something that differs from person to person",
        "@Torqueifyt\u00a0 as a highness and classic owner I am experienced both machines, it\u2019s seems that plenty of intentional degrading in place\u2026 in my experience we can\u2019t compare the highness with any other machine, it\u2019s really awesome motor bike\u2026",
        "Totally agreed brother, we too own a hness and a classic",
