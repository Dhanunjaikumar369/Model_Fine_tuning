        "Sorry guys for the late reply, yes I did try its top speed by changing real wheel sprocket and it reached till 149kmph (still I expected more), it's because I had also changed the tyres from stock tvs to Pirelli 110 section front and 140 section rear (just to be safe), since it has softer rubber compared to stock tvs tyres. Also installed a after market wind shield that you can get online, and changed the engine oil to Motul instead of tvs, changed spark plug to iridium one.\nAlthough it can achieve more speed but I think that this is more in acceleration and pickup rather than high speeds.\nStay safe\nStay happy\nRide responsibly.....\u270c\ufe0f",

        "@Neverseen746\u00a0 First understand the need for this, wider tyres have high friction that may impact fuel economy and high speed of your bike, plus it could be little heavy on the budget( if considering Pirelli), usually wide tyres are used when you ride as a street/track racer and take sharp turns while using your lean angle skills. \nTo answer your question......\nYes you can upgrade either of them but make sure to keep the difference between the front and rear tyre width same as earlier.\nI hope you got my point...",
