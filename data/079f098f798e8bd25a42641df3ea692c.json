        "One of the best bike from Suzuki \u2764\ufe0f impressive performance & speed bro \ud83d\udc93",
        "Please try adding some action footage too. Looking at a parked bike is not very exciting \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd",
        "The headlight design is kinda love or hate design... Suzuki could've offered the same design as the international model of GSX-R 250...it just looks way better than this design...",
        "Worth Buying over Svartpilen250/Duke250? Like the Breaks,pickup,handling",
        "Sir why do some gixxer 250 bs6 versions have yellow sticker saying 250 on the fairing while others don't ??? Any Idea??",
        "It is liquid cooled! Are you sure?  Please check out the gps topspeed of this beautiful angel",
        "Can a hero motocorp modifie bike and give me brand new bike with modification \ud83c\udf31\ud83c\udf31\ud83c\udf31\ud83d\ude0e",
        "Awesome , thank you so much for your feedback \ud83d\ude4f",
        "Thank you , in the next video u r there bro",
        "@WeekendOnWheels\u00a0 thanks alot. Cant wait.",
        "Yes bro , it's a beautiful machine",
        "In next video it's all going to be action footage . Hope that helps and thank you so much for your feedback \ud83d\ude4f",
        "@WeekendOnWheels\u00a0 super... Look forward to it \ud83d\ude0e",
        "Thank you \ud83d\ude4f for your feedback and support .",
        "Thank you for sharing your feedback . Appreciate that",
        "Well I won't think its a right comparison as the earth naked bike and this one is a failed bike how were talking about breaking pick up and handling this motorcycle is brilliant the suspensions are also very very good in this motorcycle",
        "@WeekendOnWheels\u00a0  I know it naked but the Engine capacity is same na so Which would be a better choice",
        "Thi they are same capacity there is little difference between the naked and faired.  The very first point is the wind blast in naked you will have higher wind blast as against the faired.  You definitely have an advantage on the fair when it comes to touring or when you go to long ride and with the gixxer because of its upright sitting position it's an advantage that you get over the naked to ride a motorcycle which looks aggressive but at the same time very good riding position and the power vise it is well distributed power across all gears compared to the Duke or the svartpilen 250. Duke or svartpilen are high revving machines.",
        "@WeekendOnWheels\u00a0  okay so it's worth Buying GIXXER250SF right?",
        "What ur talking is about the new colour scheme , that's why that difference",
        "This the BS6 version is liquid cooled , sure will test the top speed and keep u posted",
        "@WeekendOnWheels\u00a0 please  go on",
        "Thank you for your suggestion \ud83d\ude4f",
        "@WeekendOnWheels\u00a0 actually the thing is that  I have pulsar220f at present, but I want to go for some other faster and Japanese engined bike , gixer sf250 looks beautiful simultaneously faster also which actually satisfy my requirements bcs I used to do long races with bikes within 200cc segment but unfortunately my pulsar220f couldn't able to exceed 132kmph speed and also poor acceleration is significant in my bike that made me to loose races against r15v3 , mt15 , himalayan, jawa42, and many other . I also have duke250 as a second option in my mind but I give major priority to gixr sf250 bcs of its magnificent beauty as a sports bike which is not present in the duke250, but the matter of tragedy is that the government imposes speed restrictions in sportsbike that leads to the entry of bs6 bikes in market which are detuned and lacking in acceleration, I am worried about this thing in gixr also and eager to know wheather gxr sf 250 bs6 versions are now able to reach 154km per hr at all or not , bcs based on this factor I am waiting for purchasing this bike, though duke250 is bit faster than this bike",
        "Thank you for your detailed input. Now coming back to Gxr SF 250 , it's a true sports touring and a satisfying motorcycle for sure . The performance of the motorcycle is brilliant again thanks to Japanese for making such amazing machine. I have done a top speed of 135 kmph without any issue and the motorcycle still had some punch. I had to cut down my speed coz of traffic on the highway. I would suggest you to go take a test ride of the motorcycle for yourself and understand the dynamics of the Gxr SF 250. KTM 250 is definitely quicker than Gxr SF 250 but at high speed it has a lot of windblast which makes the ride very uncomfortable.",
        "They gave it to me to review the motorcycle that's all \ud83d\ude01",
        "@WeekendOnWheels\u00a0 oh...ahahaha"
