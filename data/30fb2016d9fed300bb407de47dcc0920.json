        "We already have our verdict out! But, which according to you is the better #RoyalEnfield motorcycle to buy - the #Classic350 or the #Meteor350? Do let us know your choice in the comments below.",
        "Meteor is a wonderful bike! I have used it for more than 10 months and rode to 5 different states. It's been a wonderful ride so far. Absolutely in love with this bike.",
        "The Meteor 350 is one of those unique cases where everything just simply came together to form a masterpiece of styling, engineering, and quality. I\u2019ve had many motorcycles in my 50+ years of riding and my Meteor is really beyond criticism - I can\u2019t find anything to complain about. It does what it was designed to do, and a little more. The power is way beyond what you would think a mere 349cc engine could produce. It\u2019s not a  racer or interstate motorcycle, and was not intended to be. It looks like a motorcycle, sounds like a motorcycle, and smells like a motorcycle. Yes, I\u2019m completely happy with it.",
        "This guy is biased towards meteor. I test drove both and on a contrary what ever he said is opposite (except some points). I found classic much more comfortable in city. Looks wise meteor is stunning.",
        "I felt the same way. I have meteor n my brother hv classic next gen. We both rode from siliguri to sikkim n on the way we change our motorcycle. Meteor is easy to handle and comfort comparing to classic maybe bcoz of touring seat but we both felt the same. Both the motorcycle are awesome but classic is little heavier and meteor is light .",
        "I cancelled my meteor and booked the classic, a better family bike",
        "I'm a Meteor owner, yesterday I came to the dealer to make a test ride of the Classic: for me the Meteor is much better, but it's matter of taste, you need to test both than take your own decision. Btw, the Classic chrome/red finishing looks wonderful !",
        "Classic 350 is best looking",
        "U will need to remove the Tripper navigation as a positive....first of all it is not something that comes standard with both bikes it costs 5K above, second Even if one wants to go for it, It is not in stock so it must be treated as a variable not a positive ....RE is the first Bike company I know which strips its bikes of all accessories and then charges for them even something as necessary as a crash gaurd...lol.....Nothing Royal about that.",
        "My vote is for the classic 350. It\u2019s a beautiful bike that suits my age, lifestyle and personality.\ud83d\ude0e",
        "Have been riding for 50 yrs, everything from Harley\u2019s  to Honda\u2019s . The Meteor Supernova is the ticket for backroads and scenic roads.\nSmooth, comfortable, 4 gallon tank, 55-60 mph is the sweet spot, 80 mpg, hill-toe shifting.\nThis is not an interstate / freeway bike. Top speed roughy 70-75 mph.",
        "The classic is absolutely beautiful to look at.\nRegardless as to all the listed better attributes of the meteor I'd still take the classic.",
        "The wider rear tire makes the riding more enjoyable. I am a Happy & Proud owner of Meteor.",
        "Thank you for this video.  I'm taking motorcycle training this weekend and am looking at getting my first ever motorcycle.  The Meteor 350 is one of the ones that I'm seriously looking at purchasing.  I'm 51 and not wanting to fly down the highway at 100 MPH doing wheelies.  Just want to cruise around and enjoy the outdoors.",
        "Thanks for this in-depth comparison! I had already purchased the 2022 Meteor and then saw all the hype about the 350 Classic and was wondering if I had made a mistake. Thanks to this video, I have no more doubts about my decision \ud83d\udc4d\u270c\ufe0f Granted, it\u2019s all about personal preference but I don\u2019t regret my choice one bit. The Meteor is a beautiful bike and a delightful experience.",
        "Wow, what a precise review. All my doubts are cleared. This is the type of review that I was waiting for.",
        "We have the Meteor now in the US, but the Classic won\u2019t be here until next spring at the earliest. Your comparison has confirmed what I suspected: that the Meteor is worth buying now and the Classic is only really worth waiting for if you want that specific style, or if you really only care about trolling about at low speed in a high gear to enjoy the thump.",
        "I understand that the meteor might technically be better in several ways. But I just couldn't bring myself to get one over the classic 350. It just has that timeless look that I'd always be looking back over my shoulder at as I was walking away from it.",
        "Great videos I have ridden both models and bought a Meteor. It's more comfortable, gives me a better feeling due to the integrated seating position and better knee angle.\nA good feeling to have bought a better motorcycle for less money. The Classic is beautiful, but the Meteor puts a smile on my face every meter of the ride.",

After that I waited for meteor for almost 7 months, my point is looks don't matter the main thing is riding comfort and meteor is comfort compair to classic next gen , maybe something will change if you install classic touring seat. You are comparing Average just because of long windshield, if you remove that, there is no comparison between RE n Baja \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. One more thing , I felt little shortage of power. In Sikkim wherever you go either you go up or down \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 so when you ride with pillion I felt power ka kami. Others wise motorcycle engen is way far good than old Royal Enfield n kaun kehata hai vibration nahi hai \ud83d\ude02 Vibration thora hills ma number 2 may chalakay dekho vibration hai lakin achi wali vibration \ud83d\ude02.",

        "\u200b\u200b\u00a0@vikrantsingh6916\u00a0 sir, this Q is going to be a long one. Pls consider. \n\nWhich bike would you recomend between the bullet 350 black gold with the tripper as a accessory and the meteor 350 supernova. \n\nIm 6ft1. Weigh 78 kgs(athletic). Switiching from a dominar 400 due to the bent knee and committed riding . Plus heavy bike in traffic and cumbersome turning radius.\n Only reason . \n\nI still have the first gen tbird in impeccable condition adorned with white tyre walls and its on the course for its 20 year passing. Never broken down. Orignal chrome and even the horns which came with the bike in 2003.\n\nMy requirements \n\n1) Good tractibility for city and highway. Which the dominar doesnt have in the city. But the 350 bullet and meteor does.\n\n2) Comfort.(bullet 350 seems comfy for rider and pillion) Even the stock seat.\n\nTo some extent i want to keep the bike for as long as possible and not be bored of it.\nSpeed isnt my concern as i have barely crossed 100 with the domi.\nIm a sedate rider. Touring medium speed types.\n\n3) want a bike like a do it all. Easy in city and comfy by default for the highway. I would have gone in for the 650 inty.Just because of the 270 degree smooth parallel engine.\n But again knees are bent and leaning forward wrt upper body.\n\nSM 650 is not for me. I find the legs reaching out of the crash guard when on the riders foot rest upfront. In advent of a collision...the riders foot will be hit before the crash guard. In the meteor 350 its some what within the range of the crash guard.\n\nWhich would you suggest. Bullet 350 or supernova meteor 350?",

        "@vikrantsingh6916\u00a0 Thank you Vikrant.",
        "Meteor to me is a clean sheet development. The Classic on the other hand seems to have been dialled down to seem more \u2018Classic\u2019 like. And as ironic as this might sound, the Meteor to me is a truer, new-age Royal Enfield.",
        "@vikrantsingh6916\u00a0 Is it not the rebirth of the Thunderbird?",
        "@mindspinn311\u00a0 According to RE, yes. But, given the styling, the way it rides, and of course the name, clearly indicates it\u2019s nowhere as close to its so called spiritual predecessor as one would like to believe.",
        "Meteor doesn't share any parts with the Thunderbird, but it's included in the same cruiser segment.",
        "You won't like meteor once you see the classic in black color. Such a beauty",

Btw he didn't tell you RE used plastic in some parts of meteor!!",
        "I first ordered a Meteor. Then I saw the Classic 350, and changed the order. I didn't want to have this wonderful Meteor, and always look at the Classic...",
        "Fantastic review. This is what we are looking for. Bored of those videos with diplomatic reviews, everyone needs to accept the fact that 'Meteor is a better bike'.\nAnd for the pillion discomfort, our Indian market has lot of jugaads. Get the back rest extension rod and you are sorted!",
        "I LOVED the review! I like how it was so tight and organized; you kept things moving along nicely. The video felt shorter than it was.\n\nHaving said that, I'm a proud, new Meteor owner! I'd been away from riding for a couple of years, and I was itching to get back in to it. When I saw the Meteor, I fell in love! I had to have one, and on September 20th, I made a Fireball Yellow Meteor mine. I just LOVE my bike! In between and after rides, I'll go downstairs and just look at the bike... :)\n\nI've owned 10-12 bikes before the Meteor, including a 750 and an 1100. That said, at my age, I don't need the biggest, fastest bike out there. At my age, I want something fun, lightweight, and easy to manage. I don't need a bike so fast that I need to calculate the jump to hyperspace; I just want something that's fun to RIDE! Isn't that why we got in to motorcycling in the first place-to have fun?\n\nThat said, I've followed RE for years. I admired their Classic 500. I wanted to buy one, but I waited too long and they went out of production. I was sad, of course. Now, RE is bringing back the bike; not only that, it's better than ever! What can I say? I love the look of the bike. For those reasons and more, if I can swing it next year, I'll be buying a Classic 350 too. After all, my Metoer is getting lonely... :)",
        "I hope the US pricing reflects what we see here, the classic is actually a bit cheaper, something I\u2019d never have guessed!",
        "Classic is just Classic, which we love about Royal Enfield.\nMeteor is an allrounder kind of bike.",
        "The \"Reviewer\" is really good.I liked him a lot more than the motorcycle. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f From Kerala , India.",
        "Meteor looks resembles some High cc bikes like harley...the design is absolutely next level",
        "I am around 5.7 and weight 60. Never felt that I will own an RE. Its been one year with meteor and it is really a beast.. It feels so light... Easy to handle in traffic... On long rides, it gives a wonderful experience... Though the machine is heavy, it is designed such that centre of mass is too low, feels light with maximum stability, wonderful seating posture and also braking pretty controls the vehicle... If you really not worried about mileage, just go for it... U won't regret...",
        "Very good review thank you! I'm in the US but really wanted the Classic for its looks, so was waiting until they come to the US, but now I'll have to rethink my decision. Thank you.",
        "I have taken test ride of both and I feel both are good in its own way. I felt New Classic is better as there is almost no vibration. People always complained about RE having vibrations but I feel this time they have worked on it. \u2764\ufe0f",
        "With me it's an emotional thing. Last year a drunk driver came crashing through our property. He wrote off our truck and smashed through the shed where my Royal Enfield classic was. The bike was smashed through the shed and ended upside down on the lawn. My RE has also withstood a bush fire which came perilously close to the property. So I think I will keep this built to last classic and have no intentions of 'Upgrading' to a Meteor....By the way the first motorbike to cross from one side of Australia to the other was ridden by Winnie Wells in 1950 on a 350 RE check out her story....",
        "I too loved the meteor more. Especially the mid stellar variant of meteor. I mean both Classic 350 and meteor have the same engines. So, it comes to rider comfort which I felt was better on the meteor. I'd say look wise meteor really stood out. I am still considering between RE meteor 350 stellar and Honda Highness 350 top variant. Only drawback for meteor Stellar black is 3 to 4 months of waiting period where as Honda highness can be readily available in 4 to 5 days.",
        "Well, interesting conclusion. Nevertheless, I would always choose the Classic over the Meteor, just because it simply looks gorgeous and the small 350cc engine fits the concept perfectly (the following is course a matter of personal preference, and everybody who doesn't agree is probably right) - it is slow, and it's absolutely fine because nobody expects it to be fast, whereas the Meteor, due to its cruiser concept needs to fulfill different expectations performance-wise, what makes it simply underwhelming. So, while the Bullet checks all the boxes to be very attractive for a classic enthusiast, and being a seasoned biker with over 30 years of riding experience I'm seriously considering buying one, I see no reason other than having a restricted license for buying a Meteor.",
        "Having follwed bike reviews for quite a while, I must say Vikrant Singh is the most sensible, logical & practical in this field. I'm looking to upgrade from Honda Hornet 160R, but yet to make my mind between Honda H'Ness CB 350 & Jawa 42 2.1. Have to admit that RE Meteor 350 is also appealing, but it's weight makes me skeptical.",
        "the meteor is a more modern looking bike having said that I would like to have a choice of spoke wheels than alloys.",
        "Hi, I like your comparison of the two bikes, I sold my classic 500cc because of two reasons - height and moving it around in garage not to hard but I have been thinking of the meteor - comfortable seat and watching this video has been great. now of to view it, Jim aged 81",
        "Awesome review making it crystal clear for an eager and confused buyer to make an informed decision, and enable the Royal Him/Her to enjoy years of enthusiastic and kool riding against the wind in a cruiser with a legendary DNA. Ride safe, stay safe, happy and healthy. Best Wishes from Darjeeling. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83e\udd13",
        "Did all the test rides, lived a day with each motorcycles. I apparently selected classic 350 red chrome. It all boils down to what makes you happy. The meteor imo looked amazing too, but the classic looked eye twinkling, brain shattering pretty.. \nThe engines are refined and seriously pulls better than the previous generation models. \nRide comfort wise, classic is stiffer (marginally).\nAll drops to your style of driving and requirement for looks.\nBe safe out there.. happy riding!",
        "Moving from 125/150 to RE. You are right about Meteor. Love it",
        "Thank you for such an informed and excellent review. Had a test on a Meteor, Beautiful bike, ran like a watch, but I found the seat a bit low, so eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Classic in the UK, Really prefer the look with the spoke wheels, more traditional side boxes and beautiful old skool  tank. One issue I had with the Meteor, was the heal and toe gear changer, but I guess you get used to that, though, wish the Classic had stuck to the traditional gear change lever ( even if it is on the wrong side!!} but that's giving my age away!  Both Beautiful machines, and wonderful value. Top marks to RE",
        "I am six foot five and own the Meteor and have ridden the classic. Both bikes are fantastic but the classic has more room for taller riders. My Meteor cramps me up a bit where the classic seats me in a more comfortable neutral position though the heel toe shifter on the Meteor is much easier to use for a size 14 foot as I have",
        "And this problem is generally for two heavy people. for people who weight around 70-80kgs, it's very comfy.",
        "yeah m8...100% agree to it",
        "I'm 6'3.. Would you suggest any of these bikes",
        "Dear Biker... I had Moto Guzzi Nevada, Yam XVS1300, Kawa VN900, Suzuki Intruder 850, RE Classic 500.\n\nI just ordered a blue Meteor. Not available yet. In the meantime I saw the Classic, too beautiful... and I changed the order... I'll be delivered tomorrow in chrome red.\n\nBut like you, I'll let some time pass, and maybe buy a Meteor (very similar to the excellent Intruder, but less big, less heavy, more modern).",
        "These bikes costs more than per capita annum\n\nIn USA they would cost at most 1 month's pay",
        "Actually in Italy the Classic is priced a little bit higher than the Meteor",

        "Meteor anytime its so comfortable that one can ride so long without any discomfort",
        "I have driven both at a time. Personally i felt new classic 350 more comfortable. Even though have same engine specs. Classic's engine is slightly more refined than meteors. And if you are 6 feet or above prefer classic above meteor. New classic is far better than the old generation. Cruiser lovers go for meteor. But my personal opinion is that you ride meteor once for 50 kms and don't go for  it by seeing only the review. These are my personal opinions.",
        "1. Classic is easier to handle in heavy traffic in the city as compared to meteor. 2. Seat height in classic  is far more  comfortable than meteor  for tall person.\n3. Gear position is perfect (when it comes to handle in the city) in classic which is not there in meteor. \n4) Pillion ride is also important if u go for a costly bike which is better in Classic.\n5) Both street ride and highway ride is comfortable in Classic, but in meteor only highway ride is comfortable.\nI should say meteor is more often for  riding in highway rather than day today life intracity journey.",
        "Absolutely excellent review. Thank you very much. The only people who can really review these bikes properly are people from or in India because this is where the bike has had decades of testing on all-terrain.

        "Spent my money on the classic, for me it is the better of the two and has RE's timeless design. The Meteor is a great machine but looks like every other cruzer styled machine out there.",

        "Generally, if one of these is your only ride, I would suggest Classic 350, not because it's the better motorcycle but because it's an all rounder motorcycle (city + highway) (7:3). But if you already have your commuters parked at your garage then with free mind you can go with Meteor 350. Classic although now in my honest opinion doesn't look that much attractive in terms of styling but given the paint schemes and brand value is still a good to go bike. Now comes to road presence, you believe me or not but now it's really hard for classic now to beat the road presence of Meteor... It looks just as it's name on the roads. The big reason is that eyes of people are now fatigued with looks of classic 350. But Yes feature wise, comfort wise, design and R&D wise meteor is the best motorcycle. What I feel classic lost its feel, for what it has been known for. Now it's just a bike with impression of new age. In this way actually it lost its legacy. \n\nIT'S LIKE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YAMAHA RX-Z and YAMAHA YBX. (Old classic vs new classic) . 2 stroke lovers will know what I meant to say.",

Classic handled broken roads better. Suspension on meteor was very very stiff passing the jolts right through your back. \n2. Classic was easy to push and pull. Yeah, shin hit the pedals. I guess you get used to it eventually. \n3. Classic felt slightly more in control\n4. Both seats were comfortable\n5. Didn't ride the highway. But, I took a meteor on an 11 km highway stretch some months ago. It felt at home. \n\nI don't know whether the test drive conditions of both motorcycles may have given this feeling.\n\nAm I the only one with this experience?",

For RE, this is its bread and butter. It\u2019s survival depends on these bikes. For Honda, The same goes for the Activa and the Shine. The CB is just another bike to plug a gap. So, the focus is lesser. Jawa has production issues. If that was sorted, it would have managed to create a significant niche for itself. Bu that\u2019s not really happened.\n3 - As for the Bullet being cheaper than these two\u2026 that\u2019s because it\u2019s it\u2019s still on the old platform and not the new generation J platform like these two bikes.",

        "For me the choice is a no brainer. I plan to buy a new Meteor hopefully early next year. I have owned a 2013 Royal Enfield B5 Bullet since new, and have put just over 15K miles on it. I scrapped the EFI and replaced it with an Amal carburetor using a kit from Hitchcocks. I also trashed the stock catalytic converter pipe and installed a new aftermarket pipe, also from Hitchcocks. The bike now runs and sounds 10 times better than it did to begin with. I have had a fe problems during those 8 years and 15K miles, the most serious one was when the rear brake locked up (I applied the rear brake and then it would not release)  I still ride that bike, and plan on keeping it forever. But it does have one HUGE problem which cannot be fixed, and that is tube type tires. I have had 5 flats in those 15K miles, 4 of them in the rear. I have to carry around a truckload of tools and parts to fix a flat, and had to call a tow truck once. Tube type tires are MUCH easier to puncture than tubeless tires, and MUCH harder to repair. I have Ride-On in another bike, with tubeless tires, and have NEVER had a flat, in over 80K miles. And if you do have a flat with a tubeless tire, you can just plug it, air it up, and be on your way. I just have to laugh when I see a bike with EFI, ABS, and front and rear disc brakes, and stone age tube type tires. I will NEVER buy another bike with tube type tires. \n\nI am hoping the Meteor runs better than the 2013 Bullet did with EFI, and if not hopefully there will be some kind of tuner for it. I also hope someone makes an aftermarket exhaust for it, so I can get rid of the catalytic converter. There really is no competition for the Meteor. The Genuine G400 has tube type tires, and the Honda Rebel 300 is the ugliest bike I've ever seen in my life.",

Less heavy.\nIn reality, for me there is no noticeable difference. Because the weight difference is small.\n2/ We hear that the Meteor is more \"dynamic\nIt's a bit true because the diameter of the rear wheel is a bit different. \nBut here again it's not very noticeable. And neither the Meteor nor the Classic are racing machines.\n3/ more accessories on the Mereor: this is true (front bubble, tripper, tubeless rims... and all cheaper!)\nSo why buy the Classic?\n4/ Classic: The engine is in raw aluminum finish. \nIt's beautiful if you maintain it well. The shape of the top engine is more ''round'' than on Meteor. Vintage touch in more...\n5/ In conclusion: why did I buy Royal Enfield? \nBecause the look is sublime. \nYes, it's the look that made me choose this brand (I had a Bullet before). \nSo in the choice, you have to forget the almost identical performances. \nWhich look do you want? This is the real good question, and in my opinion the only real question if you hesitate between the 2 machines.\n\n6/ note: The 2 machines are beautiful...\nThe Claiic is more expensive (I don't understand why) \nBut if I buy more expensive, I sell more expensive).\n\nHi everyone.",

        "Well very precise and to the point differentiators, well done. I was also in two minds which one to go for, and I am a relatively new rider(yeah I learnt to ride during my work stint in Malaysia) and the traffic we have in India is a different story, but I chose the Classic (alloy wheels), for my height which is 6 feet, I felt the Classic was a more involved riding, having said that Meteor is good, actually the SuperMeteor is one to look out for. But, I love the Bullet (BSVi), that\u2019s like a mean machine and I get the confidence to take it anywhere. Being an ardent RE fan, I also love the Interceptor, maybe if I can afford, will go for that next.",
        "If you could also choose between these 2 and the Himalayan/upcoming Scram 411, which one would you choose? Himmy seems to have more power, suspension travel etc. But the thought of that big 411cc single generating heat in the city and the odd horror story about chassis failures are holding me back. Not sure if those fears are justified though :)",

Meteor has that generic cruiser look I've seen from Japan since 1976. Riding position: I couldn't ride that Meteor with my knees up high for more than 30 minutes. May be fine for shorter people. As to the weight of the Classic, I had a 492 pound Vstrom for 15 years & the weight is VERY high. Classic would feel like a bicycle to me. Unfortunately the Classic isn't on Royal Enfield's USA website. They would sell lots of these in the USA just on the looks.",

I've seen a Classic with a windscreen an I loved it so much. What I also like at the Classic is the fact that it may have a engine guard. This things is very hard to be found on this motorcycle class.

The rider triangle on this makes a perfect 90 on the footpeg. It's not much of a cruiser as you'd expect it to be. \n\nOne shall notice the same on a test ride. It's half-assed in my opinion. A hybrid of sorts lol.\n\nI still went with the classic cause I like it. Pillion comfort is an added advantage in this. I agree that the meteor is a better bike overall. Happy riding!",

        "An informative review.\nI live in the UK and after a few years away from motorcycling due to ill health I want to get back into it unfortunately my old 1988 BMW R80RT is knackered and it will cost more than it's worth to put it back on the road.\nI also live in outer London and the BMW doesn't comply with the Ultra Low Emissions Zone (ULEZ) so it would currently cost me \u00a312.50 per day just to take it off my drive. So I've been looking at both Royal Enfield and Triumph as possible replacements. The current BMW's, while desirable, are way too expensive.\nAs the bike will be for recreational purposes I was prepared to compromise on some aspects of practicality.\nI've been looking at the Royal Enfield 350's and the 650 Interceptor as well as the Triumph Bonneville.\nThe UK prices of the 350's are \u00a33880 to \u00a34040 for the Meteor depending on the specification chosen.\n\u00a34280 to \u00a34440 for the 350 Classic depending on chosen specification.\nThe 650 Interceptor is \u00a36039 to 6539 again depending on the specification chosen.\nFor a new Triumph Bonneville (900cc) prices start at \u00a39395 or the Street Twin (also 900cc) from \u00a38595\nAs a significant portion of my riding will be on UK motorways where the speed limit is 70mph and most people do about 10mph faster I think that the Meteor or the 350 Classic will have problems keeping up.\nSo I'm seriously looking at the 650 Interceptor as it is a reasonably priced 650 styled very much like the Triumph.\nA new Triumph would be too expensive and even a 5 year old Triumph is the same price or more than the price of a new Interceptor. Any used Triumph over about 6 years old will be cheaper, however they don't comply with the London ULEZ so are not worth considering.\nIf my riding was just going to be around London or within 30 to 50 miles of home.\nBased on information from your YouTube review and others that I have watched if I was to buy one of the Royal Enfield 350's I would definitely choose the Meteor.\nThanks for a very informative review.",

I am 5'11\"....Ill need to test the meteor I guess grudgingly though I love the retro classic and even though the meteor is made out to be a cruiser it is not a typical cruiser...in a way it is a comfortable roadster....so let me see if what the reveiwer says it is better than need to test it out.

In fact, for the engine, we should say solid aluminum (more beautiful than chrome when it is well polished).\nAnd maybe that's why I finally fell for the Classic 350. I love the old school polished aluminum. The Meteor is beautiful, but it doesn't have the class of the Classic... for my taste. I may lose a little agility.

        "A very honest comparison between the two models that gives both the positives and negatives - from your point of view. \n\nAs you mentioned, your younger test rider preferred the Classic. I'm sure his review would give his reasons and I wish you both did this review together.\n\nThat being said, it comes down to the fact that they're basically identical bikes, but for different riders. The Classic is a standard, while the Meteor is a cruiser. So it comes down to which style of riding do you prefer. Not which bike is better.\n\nPersonally, I'm not a cruiser rider. As far as handling goes, a lot of the time it comes down to choosing a better tire for quicker turn-in. As far as wind protection, it's a standard 8\" headlight and the are TONS of aftermarket. I have not been to their build a bike website yet, but I'll bet they even offer a passenger backrest for the Classic. \n\nI am also a fan of alloy wheels. That has kept me from buying any of the RE lineup. Making the Meteor the ONLY option in that category. I'm glad that RE offers them FINALLY on the Classic 350. Hopefully on the Classic 500 as well. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE tell RE they need to offer alloy wheels on the 650's, and even the Hymalayan!!! Get out of the stone age in at least this respect.\n\nI've been waiting for the Classic to come out and hopefully it hits North America. But I'd go for the Classic 500 in a heartbeat simply for better highway cruising. Maybe they'll take the hint and offer a Meteor 500 soon as well for cruiser riders.",

On the other hand, riders in the UK and USA have praised the Meteor no end, maybe because they haven't laid their hands on the next gen classic yet, or maybe the roads are way better there.  Could you elaborate a bit more on  your decision of putting the Meteor over the Next Gen Classic, especially with context to rider comfort over long rides of say 4-500kms a day? Regards.",

And I saw the blue Meteor, too beautiful, and only advantages. I ordered it with my eyes closed. In the meantime, the #Classic350 is presented, and my blue Meteor is not yet available.\nFrankly, I sat for an hour in front of the #Classic350.\nIt had just arrived in the dealership, so it was available.\nIt was cruel... I'm looking for a good and beautiful bike?\nOr am I looking for a bike that is maybe a little less good, but with more charm?\nGood bikes, apart from Royal Enfield, there are some.\nCharming bikes? Authentic charm? That's rare\nFinally I bought the #Classic350. More expensive to buy, it will sell for more when used. I lose the tubeless wheels, I lose the Tripper, but I preserve the authentic image of Royal Enfield which is finally the rarest thing. \nBut the Meteor, for the moment, is not expensive. Besides, there are used ones... even cheaper. I will buy both models?\nAnyway, congratulations to the Royal Enfield ''350'' Project Manager, who makes beautiful and so different bikes on the same base! Congratulations for all the finishing details, especially on the Meteor. By the way, why is the less well equipped Classic more expensive? Because it is intended for the Brand lovers?
