        "This was one of the toughest and  most agonising decisions I've had to make as I love them both. I gave into the riding position of the Meteor and loved the Fireball yellow and consoled myself by adding the extras like windscreen and touring seats with backrest. Its hard to go with your heart when your heart is split in two -lol. - But - no matter which one you end up with you will love it!",
        "I  have a Meteor. I would love to have both! I have moved down the HP scale from bigger bikes and I love it. I go for a  \"burble\" as I call it, through the countryside and it just seems more fun to be on a smaller bike. It's going to be interesting when I turn up at the ferry to France this year and see the looks of disdain from the GS \"adventure\" croud! You can't  tour on that!",
        "I bought a Meteor in November of 21 and simply love it. I also have the interceptor 650 and have to say the meteor is more comfortable and \"laid back\". It's enjoyable to ride and, in my opinion, easier to handle in all but higher winds. The 650 is more capable in the highway, of course, so I'm not referring to that aspect. As a matter of fact, the 350 is parked by the garage door as it is now my first choice to hop on to do any kind of local errands. Just my 2 cents worth.",
        "There aren't many utilitarian bikes left these days, and the Meteor is the nearest thing. Off-the-peg \"custom\" bikes tend to have lots of glittery bits, but the Meteor is almost ascetic, especially in basic form, with its black crinkle finish. The Japanese used to do plenty of such bikes (Honda CD200 Benly?) and Eastern European motorcycles had a dedicated following. These have been largely replaced by scooters in their mass markets, making the Meteor a welcome anomaly.",
        "At the end of the day, my classic 500 still puts a smile on my face, 9months later.. You are so correct, it's what you want not what other people want..",
        "I drove 2 hours yesterday to my closest RE dealer. I owned a Classic 500 and enjoyed it and wanted a new bike. I went there honestly expecting to buy the Classic 350 in the Signals version in desert tan. But, after looking them all over, sitting on them, etc., I totally surprised myself and bought a Meteor in Super Nova trim. As you pointed out, it came down to just visceral feel when I sat on each. The Meteor just won me over and to be truthful, it wasn't close! Being 70, I remember vividly all those bikes of the 60's, 70's and 80's and the Meteor just hit me as the one I wanted. Thanks for a great comparison video.",
        "Hi Stuart, where I agree with you that servicing should be done every 6,000 miles, RE say otherwise. The manual says every 3,000 miles, but I noticed that a major service is carried out every 6,000 miles. I checked this with RE and they say that the warranty would be void if the service is not done by a registered RE dealer (or VAT registered motorcycle garage) every 3,000. I have queried this with them, my argument being that the major services should be sufficient, I've not had a reply yet.",
        "I wish the Speedo on the classic wasn't so cheap looking. The paint and a everything is amazing, but the cheap plastic dash is what is a deal breaker for me. On video they look great, but in person they look cheap compared to the meteor..",
        "as another large lump, six four and 100 kilos. even though I try to be courteous unthreatening and inconspicuous. ok you can get up and stop laughing now. try as qwe might people of our size are seen as slightly dangerous and not to be annoyed",
        "I have to say that this video is right on the mark, it is an emotional purchase where you have to go with your heart.\nI gave up riding bikes a long time ago, but got sucked back in when RE brought out the Interceptor.  I didn't need a bike, my wife and I both have car's.  Sometimes the things you don't need are the things you can't do without.  \nRide safe.",
        "Thanks for this video, Stuart. As you said in 16:20 its all about getting one that matches our style of riding. \nI sold a Bullet Machismo 350 in 2007 to buy the Thunderbird, but the deal didn't work out. I lost both, and regretted for a decade and half. Always kept the dream of having a cruiser. Last year, finally having been infatuated with new Meteor, I booked it and waited indefinitely till year end, only to learn RE was in an overseas expansion spree, keeping us in india waiting, so I cancelled the booking. \n\nAfter my dealer requested I went back and tried new classic this February, and it was an instant connection that surprised me. I was surprised at how much it is my style of riding, compared to meteor. I tried meteor again over and over,  and realised cruisers are way different than my way of riding. \nMeteor is very beautiful, and for a single rider,  a bliss. But with a pillion  it is a liability to ride with all that weight on rear and a frustrating experience even for the pillion who is locked in a tiny space.\nClassic places me in a more alert rider mode, and has an unmatched precision with which I could handle it...I could predict and route it, compared to the relaxed meteor which I feel takes a bit of the controls to itself...maybe all cruisers are so. I love the meteor cockpit with so much information flashing, and in an easy to read angle. \n\nBut all this works in your kind of highways. In Indian city roads with hundreds of bikers, people and cows randomly moving, precision and alertness matters, and I'd any day choose a vehicle I can defensively wade through. Classic is a bliss in this scenario. It's design is so minimalist, so it is easy to maintain, and not much of distracting info on cockpit. \nI'll miss the beautiful meteors that turns heads, and mostly the cockpit view. But for now, this halcyon grey (kind of baby blue)  classic 350 keeps my dopamine levels intact.",
        "When I was a  lad of 16 or so, I bought my first motorcycle. It was a Sears/Gilera 124. One cylinder four stroke. The bike had belonged to my uncle,who was generous enough to let his inexperienced nephew ride it. Loved that little bike. Topped out at 60mph and back then that was enough. One, the Meteor or the Classic, would  surely send my mind travelling back in time to my days of two wheeled youth. Thanks for presenting temptation.",
        "I fell in love with the Classic when I saw it on a picture first. I ordered it without even seeing it live before in chrome/bronce. For me it is the perfect bike to \u201ede-celerate\u201c after having ridden on various motorcycles of almost all types and HP categories \ud83e\udd70",
        "I have the Meteor, my friend has the Classic. I love my Meteor and my friend loves his classic. It is a personal thing. For me it was the relaxed position and I think the fireball Meteor look great.",
        "Just passed my A motorcycle license yesterday ! \nNow I can finally go try out the RE classic and interceptor and even the meteor ! Love these videos",
        "Morning Stuart. Thanks for the comparison video. It confirms what I thought. I opted for the meteor 3 weeks ago, and genuinely think its the best bike I've ever owned! You summed it up perfectly in your meteor video when you said that you would have given your left testicle for one of these in the 80s! Thanks once again for all that you do for your subscribers",
        "Hi Stuart, once again thank you for another great episode. I\u2019m pretty well sold on the RE 350 range but I think I\u2019m more attracted to the Meteor as for me, it looks a little more modern (as I\u2019m not particularly looking for a historic/classic look). This comparison has been an enormous help. Bless you mate \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7",
        "Personally I prefer the looks of the Classic 350,was so impressive when I see it at the NEC show,a \u201cproper\u201d looking motorcycle,great video.",
        "Though I'm getting on in years, and my bike riding is now in the rear-view mirror, it's great fun to watch these videos. I live in the US, but always liked British bikes - but never could afford one. 20 years ago, I was at a motorcycle museum and saw a 1950's Bullet 500 w/chrome tank - love at first sight. Everything about it looked perfect & right. So glad to see these bikes coming back - and sensible videos about them. Thanks, Stewart.",
        "You should have bought one of each. Problem solved.",
        "@michaeljoesmith3977\u00a0  lol - I wish!. One will have to do. Actually, I'm 68 years old and it should arrive next week. I feel like a kid again counting down the days to Christmas..:) I guess that's what bikes can do to you. Take care Michael.",
        "Hey Chris, was the riding position of the Meteor better for your comfort after an hour in the saddle?  Or, was just the feeling you get when you threw a leg over?",
        "@Fred-zc8lt\u00a0 Hey Fred, - I'm a bit of an odd case and some might call me nuts. I'm odd in the respect that I didn't actually sit on either bike and came to the decision having watched every review I could find. It seemed to me that many reviewers raved about the comfortable riding position for short trips as well as longer rides.\nI lost my car here in Australia due to the major floods we had in February, which made it very difficult to reach the the nearest RE agent. (about 6 hour round trip on trains & buses) The more cruiser style of riding is what I was originally looking for when I came across the RE bikes online. My bike has since been delivered and I love it! - The riding position is extremely comfortable and very laid back for the coastal roads where I live on the Gold Coast. The Meteor suits me well on all levels and I'm more than happy with the way it rides and the joy it brings me. Having said that - I would probably have loved the classic just as much had I bought it too. :)",
        "@chrisandrew852\u00a0 \u00a0@Chris Andrew\u00a0 thanks Chris.  I 100% agree that unless you have no choice a bike is as much an emotional choice over practical.  I'm sorry to hear about the flood, I hope it didn't put you too far in a hole.\n\nI own a KLR650, thumper, single cylinder, and a Harley.  I no longer enjoy the KLR, too heavy for me on anything but a gravel or paved road.   I do enjoy the backroads of New England and am rather envious of Stu's Day Out, with the Mule; beautiful countryside,  green lanes, just jealous.  \ud83d\ude42   i think the 350cc, Meteor or Classic at putt-putt speed is a perfect afternoon on the back roads.",
        "@chrisandrew852\u00a0 I\u2019m also 68 and starting to feel the same! (I\u2019m after a meteor!) stay well buddy \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d",
        "If that's the case, then what would you do when hunter 350 hits the shelves?",
        "@debajyotisrc\u00a0 I think if we were always waiting for the next release then we would never get around to actually buying a bike. From what I have seen of the Hunter 350 so far, I still prefer the styling of the Meteor. They say that the Hunter should be a bit quicker but speed isn't a concern for me.",
        "@philtucker1224\u00a0  You take good care too Phil!. - and good luck with your meteor when it arrives.:)",
        "Ohh ! I did the same thing as you . A yellow fireball  , and add windscreen touring seats with backrest and crash bar. Can't wait to bring it home.",
        "@simodakir5990\u00a0 Congratulations Simo!..:) You will love it and i wish you the best of times riding it. I have since added the crash bar too as well as black panniers. It looks great, but now wish I had bought larger panniers. Have fun Simo, and stay safe..:)",
        "I always enjoy the ferry crossings with the big adventure bikes when I\u2019m 2 up loaded to the gun walls for a European tourer on my Vespa 300 twist and go, when I get get the question where are you going on that I love it when I say the same place as you, so put the kettle on when you get there and I\u2019ll see you a little later!",
        "Mate, you can tour on what the heck you like. I saw a British squaddie on a naked Kawasaki 900 nipping onto the ferry a few years ago with a pair of Basha poles sticking out of his day sack. Whatever floats your boat, mate.\nPS - I bet the long off-road suspension and knobbly tyres on the overweight GSs is really important on those French toll motorways!",
        "Lol.. people tour Europe on bicycles so anything with a motor from 50cc up would be preferable in my book. Stay safe and enjoy your tour Frank -  Bon Voyage!",
        "but both have same engine bro \ud83e\udd23",
        "I've just read a story about four Indian gentlemen who did a world tour on two Indian built Enfield 350s way back in 1972.  Two had to go home for family reasons half way through, but the remaining two went on to cover 67,000 miles on their bikes.  Check it out at 'Mad or Nomad' if you're interested.",
        "@ianh.6825\u00a0 Thanks for this little pointer, I'll certainly look out for this. If I may return the favour (although I suspect you may already know this one)..... Jupiter's Travels by Ted Simon. Inspired me back in the day to track down a Triumph T100.....and how I wish I'd never parted with it. Never let me down.\nLike many (it would appear) on these RE vid threads I too am of a certain age, and fantasising about rejoining the two-wheel set. Looks like it's going to be the Classic.......maybe......",
        "@cheesesk7450\u00a0 Yes, I read Jupiter's Travels as a teenager, soon after it was published.  Ted Simon went on to have further adventures and write more books, which I mean to read one day.  I'm close to retirement and emigration to a warmer climate and motorcycling is definitely something I want to take up again after a break of too many years.",
        "@ianh.6825\u00a0 i recall I must have been late teens when I picked a copy up too, can distinctly remember the shop I bought it in on a route to work - funny how some things stick so clearly (and yet others don't, haha).\nI recall his subsequent book, Riding Home, but it didn't 'impact' me so much, maybe it's time for a re-read. Also recall there was a BBC docu......maybe on Horizon or Everyman programme.\nI've had no luck with Mad or Nomad yet, but searching has uncovered some other interesting titles, so thanks again.\nGood luck with the retirement mate (I'm hitting that ballpark too), and with the move - lucky fella!\nEnjoy getting back on two wheels, no popping wheelies now young fella, haha.",
        "I bought their Love child...the super meteor 650.",
        "Very interesting!\n\nI am thinking of the Meteor 350 and the Interceptor 650 \ud83e\udd14\n\nI understand that the Continental has a nicer seat, and that swapping the Interceptor seat out makes for a nicer ride...",
        "@willhooke\u00a0 I have the premium touring seat and it's great. One thing you might need to do if swapping out seats, is to get a stronger spring or at least stretch the spring on the release that holds the pin on the seat. Mine used to come loose and I've heard of it happening to others too. I just stretched mine a tad and it seems to be working now.",
        "@gautamasakyamuni6688\u00a0 In the UK a Meteor 350 Fireball is \u00a33879. A Honda Cub is \u00a33699. Prices are relative.",
        "@gautamasakyamuni6688\u00a0 Yet people travel round the world on Royal Enfields.",
        "@gautamasakyamuni6688\u00a0 My last bike was a BMW. I'm not a motorcycle snob, I'll ride anything and everything, and have owned all Japanese bikes with the exception of Kawasaki, from 50cc to 1000cc. Enjoy whatever you are riding.",
        "In India and Japan Honda released CB350 to compete with Enfield. That's also a good bike that would do well in UK.",
        "The manual doesn't say every 3000 this has been going around for over 3 yrs now. it is simply an inspection. I suggest you consult the consumer rights Act 2015",
        "@stuartfillingham\u00a0 Yes I agree, it's just an inspection, that's why I queried it.",
        "\"Sometimes the things you don't need are the things you can't do without.\"\nYou're not just perceptive but have the knack of wording it right.\nThat's why I bought a Harley instead of a car. 8 years down the line, at age 50, I am grateful I made that decision.",
        "I gave up riding for 9 years when I my child was born because it seemed 'sensible'. The urge didn't go away and I ended up buying a fast car at one point but eventually I realised what I was really wanting again. Now I'm back to full speed on the Gixxer but I'm starting to get a bit of a cruising urge. Maybe I need to look at the scenery not just the next turn in and braking point. I'd keep the Gixxer as well but these Enfields are enticing.",
        "I took test ride of both yesterday and your opinion is spot on. I went in showroom with meteor in mind mainly for its contemporary looks and exclusivity relative to classic. The best thing I liked about Meteor was it's meter was in such a place you didn't have to look down at all and felt very natural. I loved seeing the gear position indicator. Then when I was about leave the showroom I requested clasic 350 test ride. The thing with classic was the bike felt like I have owned it for decade. The seat was more comfortable. Really impressed. Just need to take test drive of CB350 to finalize my decision b/w these 3.",
        "Welcome to the motorcycle community! Kind regards Kobus the Netherlands \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4b!",
        "It's never too late to realize the dream Chris. Get an Enfield now!",
        "TBH I love your authentic accented / intonation voice .... the right emphasis in every sentence. Makes the content so well weighted !",
        "You are so right about western restraint. I have been sitting on that fence for a while now and I've just decided that regardless of the practicalities, the chrome classic is the one for me. I no longer commute and are in a position to make that choice for myself. It feels slightly naughty due to still hearing my father in my ear when it comes to money, but at 63, I'm actually making what you  rightly call an emotional choice for (perhaps) the first time. Cheers and happy riding :)",
        "I have a halcyon black classic and very happy with it. Winter salt has started to get to the spokes on the rear wheel but I bought the bike mainly as transport and \u00a31 for \u00a31 it is by far the best bike for my particular needs. Top speed is not a problem even on a clear M25 and urban performance is nigh on perfect. I bought the bike as a transport solution and as an enjoyable treat so by my calculations the savings mean the bike will have paid for itself in the first year (5/6000 miles approximately) so the enjoyable treat part is pretty much free of charge.",
        "I am an owner of Meteor 350-Stellar Red . Its wonderful experience to ride a legend in busy streets as well as cruising the Highways.",
        "Thanks Stuart for another down to earth review. I gave up motorcycling in 2002, and had no intention of returning, but happened to catch Henry Cole riding a Meteor on, \"The Motorbike Show\" This whetted my appetite, and last August I had a test ride. Lovely bike, but after a gap of 20 years, and at 74,  decided after the test ride,  that I was too old and too stiff for another motorcycle\nHOWEVER, when the Classic 350 was launched last September, all common sense went out of the window, and in December when they appeared on the R E UK website I ordered one. \u00a0\nHad it for about 6 weeks now and I'm 50 years younger! They certainly got it right when they used the term \"Reborn\"  As you say, both super bikes, but very different in character and enormous fun  \" Ars long Vita Brevis !\" Ride safe",
        "Outstanding comparison Stuart. \nI have been waiting for this, but I am still sat on the fence. Looks wise, the Classic is tops and pulls at my heart, but the Meteor is so close and with a bigger tank and lower seat (for a shrinking 65 year old) I am probably pushed towards the Meteor. I am not sure about the slightly forwards footrests, I would have to try them. As a guy with an engineering background that modified everything he ever owned, I would modify this but still keep some sort of heel-n-toe shifter.\nI guess I should stop talking about it and test ride both.\nThanks for the great channel.",
        "My wife was looking for a new bike at just the moment the Meteor was introduced,then the classic was shown which we ordered with out seeing one in the flesh.I have to say that I'm a classic bike nut having a number of them so the classic appealed just for it's looks alone.Having now ridden this little bike I'm gob smacked at how good it is,the finish on ours is top quality and it's the red/chrome like yours so no complaints.To ride it is more than the sum of it's parts,comfortable handles really well and the motor feels like it's got more than 20bhp,it also makes both of us smile it's easy for her and fun enough for me.If Enfield decide to make a 500 version I wont be able to get my money on the table quick enough,we love it.",
        "I truly believe that choosing a Royal Enfield (any model) is definitely a choice that ignores the status quo. While they have gained popularity since the 650 Twins, prior to that they were often questioned why towards owners who knew what they have. Nothing us Enfield riders could say would convince anyone who wasn\u2019t an Enfield rider. I\u2019m okay with that because I rarely explained myself to others, nor did I ever bother justifying owning my Classic 500 and my Himalayan. \n\nHaving recently ridden the Meteor, I have to say I believe it\u2019s one of RE\u2019s best and highest quality bike they\u2019ve made. Even a cut above the 650 Twins. Production quality, component quality, and fit and finish is definitely noticeable to me. I won\u2019t say much more as I\u2019m soon to release my own opinion here for the Australian bike. However, I am a fan. I don\u2019t get the \u201chodgepodge\u201d feeling from it. In fact I like that there are common parts from other models which pay homage as you say. And after all, every other brand uses the same parts bin for so many models across any given motorcycle company. Engines, indicators, instruments, levers, etc are all shared. So it\u2019s great to see RE really have honed down these entirely different bikes while sharing major and minor components yet making each bike look, feel, and ride different to one another.",
        "Hi Stuart, I\u2019m a Yorkshireman living in Wisconsin, USA. I love both the Classic and the Meteor but preferred the look of the Classic, however purchased the Meteor for one reason; it fit me better! I\u2019m vertically challenged, my inseam being 27 inches.  \nLove your reports and hearing your accent.",
        "Not had a bike in years but I can\u2019t resist arranging a test ride on a classic 350 this weekend.",
        "I was done with bikes after nearly 50 years of riding. I sold my pan as it was becoming silly, kept my xj600 to tinker with when I saw a meteor outside a shop, within a month I had one. I was not sure I did the right thing, but after 600 miles I couldn't be more happy with this bike. It does everything I ask of it. The more miles the better it's getting.",
        "Rode the Meteor, Classic and Interceptor. The Meteor made me grin the most so got my purchase. I noticed quite a significant difference in the riding position between the Meteor (easy going) and the Classic (sit up/on more). The Meteor also just felt so right when I took it out, so easy to hop on and go. Really pleased I got it, and also the previous owner had arrange to have the heel taken off the heel/toe setup which I don't like (so solved that for me) and had run it in and done the first service, so jobs-a-good-un ! One thing worth mentioning, I'd read online that from May RE will be dropping the Tripper from the Meteor as it says it's having a problem sourcing the chips for it - don't know if that is true. Keep up the great vids :-)",
        "Did a test ride with the Classic 350 because the meteor wasn't available for a test ride. Just to feel the engine but I made up my mind before the tesride. If the test ride would be successfully it would be the meteor. So one of these days a Meteor fireball (Yellow) will be in my garage. Motorcycle number 26. Have had lots of bikes. From scooter, to cruiser, to sport touring with a lot and less HP. Last bike before this meteor was a Husqvarna Vitpilen 401. Great bike and did it all but in comparison to the meteor it was only fun at high rev 's and the meteor is way more relax to ride. With the Vitpilen and many other bikes I rode a bike and the smile on my face came only up if I made it on time for an appointment, not for the ride itself. After the test ride, the smile was there again after losing it for many many years.",
        "Nice comparison - compliment for this\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\nThe advantage of the classic is, that it don't needs to explain itself - it's a motorcycle in looking and  power how our fathers and grandfathers rode 70 yrs ago.\nIn comparison the Meteor is just a cheap (but well made), underpowered asian pseudo cruiser. \nBut if you compare both without looking trough the vintage glasses I would prefer the Meteor.\nAlso the Meteor offers more motorcycle for the money.\nHeart says Classic, mind says Meteor.\nIf you can't afford both, like me, it's really a very hard decision.",
        "I've just tested both these  today, ( and the hunter) although  that's not the style I'm quite after, they are all superb bikes, I can't get over the pricing, there insanely  good bike's for the money, very very smooth.\nAfter 25 Yr on superbikes  I've realised it's bot really a pleasant experience!\nAll the trouble of getting ready, unlocking all the bike from its many chains an locks...... then out you've to be like a terminator constantly scanning the road , tense and alert like a coiled spring, then get home wrap it all up again and relax.\nIt's not enjoyable biking at all.\nThis is more like biking ( meteor /classic/hunter) sit back relax enjoy, big grins..........\nGood video pal.",
        "I've noticed over here in the states I haven't seen any of the red and chrome 350 Classics, but the other color schemes are available. \nI really want the one you have. I love the color combo and chrome. Reminds me of a vintage BSA in some ways too.",
        "I like both bikes, but for me the Meteor is a bit more comfortable. So it\u2019s probably going to to be the Supernova brown Meteor without the winddeflector \ud83d\ude01",
        "I got a Classic 350 and it's just awesome, love it \u2764\ufe0f",
        "I would ride an hommage of my youth , hence the classic and the pleasure of having it shine like we had to do often with its chrome offerings",
        "Worrow (as the locals say around here) Stuart.\nThe deed is done. Thanks to your videos (and also those of Craig y Llyn), I have (today) sold my lovely old, 1972, BSA B50SS and purchased, without ever trying out or even seeing in the flesh, a late 2019, low mileage, Royal Enfield Classic 500 Trials.\nThe change should help my poor knees, especially the right one, and bring a post-Covid smile back to my face.\nThank you Stuart (& Craig) for turning my head from one part of the Midlands to another (okay, stretching it, Brum to Reddich sound better than Waste land to India)\nI\u2019ll let you know how it goes.\nCheers\nStay safe\nGeoff",
        "I worked out that it is cheaper to run both a small motorbike AND a car, than it is just to run a car. That was in 1971 when I commuted 15 miles each way into London, long before all this emissions and congestion stuff.",
        "If there is truly an \"elixir of youth\", it comes on two wheels.",
        "I'm 73 and agree with you.  All things otherwise equal between the two, I'd have to opt for the lower seat and bigger tank of the Meteor.  A friend of mine just bought one.  Not a fan of heel/toe shifters when you own multiple bikes...",

        "I like what you said around 3:20 that\u2019s why I love my Meteror and now will purchase the Classic signals.   Had to do a little convincing though to convince my wife.  Owning both will make me a better person.",
        "At the prices they sell them you can buy both the Classic and the Meteor, and still have money left over from what you\u2019d spend on just one bike with other manufacturers. In these increasingly troubled fiscal times, Royal Enfield is doing its bit to provide a modern day motorcycle joy fest.",
        "Hey Uncle Stu, the best comment ever that buying a bike is an emotional thing linked to your heart. Go with your heart, try as many bikes as possible - unfortunately I\u2019ve bought too many over the years. Now I have a Classic 350 as I preferred the looks to a Meteor but they are essentially the same bike. I have a friend who likes the Meteor and also another who adored the Classic - to be clear this latter has a Fireblade, Buell, soon to be joined by a Suzuki GSX~S1000GT (or something like that) and he just adored the look of the Classic. I have something else for touring and yet the the Classic is joyous to potter around on\u2026.not to mention the 100 mpg in today\u2019s crisis and yes I\u2019m guilty of looking for my reflection when going through say Painswick or similar country towns. A tin box is useful but any excuse\u2026..!",
        "Wow\u2026very good comparo. I will say the Meteor (especially in yellow) still does it the most for me, but the more I've watched you tooling along on the Classic, the more enamored of it I've also become. Again, it's a case of \"one is neat, the other, keen.\" Get both? Well, they're almost cheap-enough\u2026 ;-)",
        "I had a ride on the meteor on Tuesday, what a great fun ride it was too, really comfy and despite being new with only 75 miles on the clock it rides and pulls great it is a bigger bike feel than you would expect.  I have a test ride booked for tomorrow (Sat) morning on the classic, must say that the green coloured version of the classic is really attractive, although the red of the meteor is just as attractive, coupled with the rider touring seat, looks great.\noh my what to buy.... \ud83d\ude42",
        "Looking forward to the comparison of the new 350 and the discontinued 500.\ud83d\udc4d",
        "I feel I have to say this at the top: Neither of these machines will ever be in my garage. I've got a 650 INT, and it suits me to a T. I wanted a bike that would go 70 for over an hour, and where I ride, you find yourself on a freeway-- like it or not-- for over an hour to GET to where you want to ride. That said, I applaud RE for making changes to their long legacy of thumpers. To break into the world market, 1940's and 50's technology meant you won't get anywhere in the US outside of cult status-- and they would all have the reputation Harley enjoyed in the AMF years (free oil leak pan and set of wrenches included with every purchase!). That RE is revamping these bikes, updates that with any other brand would have occurred over several years rather than in the last two or three, gives them instant credibility as a serious manufacturer. They found their niche, they make bikes to fill it, and I'm dead certain they'll be the \"oldest continuous brand of motorcycles produced\" into the next generation and more. Hats off, to RE, and Uncle Stu for keeping us informed.",
        "Great advice as always Mr F and, having wasted far too much money over the years on bikes that didn\u2019t really suit me, advice I wish I\u2019d had available as a younger chap. I love my C350 and honestly can\u2019t think of a bike I\u2019d rather own regardless of price.",
        "I am one of those who asked how tall you are, and what you said is fine, but here\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for. Years ago I owned a BMW airhead and it fit me better than any other bike ever has. I\u2019d love to find something with what in the world of bicycles would be considered a larger frame size. The search continues.",
        "I bought a 2023 super nova used, I bought it because of the riding position over buying a classic 350. I also looked at the hunter 350, but again the foot peg position was not going to work for me. Like most have stated the meteor 350 has a much more upright riding position and with the foot pegs farther forward, it enables my legs to be in a more relaxed position keeping my hips and knees from cramping up. Great bike for the senior crowd who want to still ride and not willing to settle on a scooter like bike just yet. This endorsement comes from a person having broken his pelvis while riding my Harley Crossbones 3 years ago and is now disabled. It\u2019s all about the Ride comfort now days, Happy riding everyone!",
        "Great video. It wasn\u2019t a contest for me, although I like the Meteor, I wanted the classic, and I have been really surprised at how much I\u2019m enjoying it. For me it\u2019s like riding a 1950s classic bike which is very well behaved.",
        "The knack of sneaking the new motorcycle into your garage is buy the one that has striking resemblance ..ie: colour to the previous one... otherwise that chillingly cold question 'Whats the new bike doing in the Garage'. This will, perhaps lead to all sorts of  other questions that you won't be able answer with any honesty. If retired you wont even be able to justify the cost by saying its cheaper to use for work.....Regarding the 'which bike'  I rode a 350 Enfield about Goa...(with then wife riding pillion)... quite a few years ago now ...perhaps a nostalgia trip....The 350 classic would be my choice.",
        "Hi Stuart, i think you brought it to the point about the choice for a bike\ud83d\udc4cin this case for me it was clear, as a lover of classic motorcycles it could only be the Classic, although i have to admit the Meteor is a nice bike. About the fit and finish, i ordered initially a Halcyon black, but the dealer couldn't give any delivery date at all, so he proposed me to switch to a Chrome/Bronze that had just arrived to him. I fell in love with that color so i made the switch. After 250 km done, i washed the bike and give it a wax protection. This allowed me to have a more detailed and closed look and i have to say that i noticed also some minor flaws. The paint job around the tank lock is not perfect, the chrome at the low end of the fenders seems to be a little dull, but nothing really dramatic. I knew i could, at this price point, note expect the same paint job quality as on my HD Ultra Limited. The one thing that annoyed me was that many spokes of the rear wheel seem to be oxidized, which is not normal after 250 km ridden in dry conditions and a bike stored in a heated garage. The dealer agreed with me and asked for a replacement for the wheel, we will see, no answer til today.\nOther than that, it is great bike to ride, every time i look at it i warms up my heart. 500 km service to be done next week, installation with the DNA Filter und cover planned.....",
        "Rented a Meteor, loved the ride but wanted the Classic looks. Fast forward, just took delivery of the Classic 350. After riding about 30 minutes my back gets sore which I did not experience on the Meteor. I will have to play around with the ergonomics to get more comfortable with the Classic. No regrets, the Classic always draws a crowd. Just needs a few tweaks to make it more comfortable. I had to do the same adjustments on my Suzuki Boulevard and eventually dialed it in.. My suspicion is I have to adjust the handlebar position with a set of risers.",
        "I have the 2 tone brown supanova coming next week\n2021 model\n $8300 aud\n On the road. Solo reg. Here in queensland. Just sold my can am spyder. And keen to get back on 2 wheels. Am 77 years. Safe riding everyone\ud83d\udc4b",

        "At 62 and a little banged up, my heart wants the Classic but my head argues for the Meteor knowing my back and my knees will thank me later during washings and cleanings. Doing the valve adjustment I can see as fun and satisfying, polishing chrome and cleaning spokes not so much. So when my Triumph sells it will be the Meteor for me. I am ready for lower, slower and lighter. Thanks Stu! But wait! In the States they have a Classic blacked out like the Fireball and with allow rims. Damn, I am confused again.",
        "There was actually a time when Royal Enfield released bikes in New America under the Indian Motorcycle badge. Being a fan of both Enfield and Indian, I find that absolutely fascinating.",
        "Bought my Meteor after a 30ish year of non ownership/riding. Had a few 350's back in the day and  the moment I road it away from the showroom fell for it. I've done 6500km in three months and it's great. As you do rightly say, ignore what other people think you should have and buy what you like.",
        "Another well thought out and informative video. Thank you Stuart it is a pleasure to watch your work \ud83d\udc4d",
        "So having turned up to test ride the classic 350, it wasn't ready, so they sent me out on a meteor for a while and I'm glad I got to ride it again. Then went out on the classic, a bronze/chrome coloured new, 3 miles on the clock ! Had a great ride and love the noise from the exhaust, it's much more thumper, classic than the sound from the meteor, you do get a pop or two when winding off the throttle, absolutely loved it. What a machine, it does seem smoother then the meteor though, which may seem an odd thing to say, definitely a much more upright ridging position compared the meteor's slightly laid back attitude. But now I have to decide which colour I prefer for the classic as that is definitely my choice of ride. Do I go for the chrome, lovely looking bike, the full black with single seat or the green/brown with tan seats?\noh what a dilemma to be in!!",

        "I\u2019ve ridden motorcycles and scooters since 1967.  I have always liked old bikes and search for motorcycle museums when we travel in the states. One of my current bikes is a 1964 Honda CA200. I love the quirky looks and light weight but even though it is a Honda it has broken down multiple times in the past ten years. What I think that I want is a classic looking motorcycle that has modern reliable components. The Classic seems to fit my wants. The niggles for me are: the weight, the lack of power, reliability, and the distance to the dealer. If I can arrange a test ride, some of those concerns may disappear. I waited too long to buy the RE 500 Bullet and they are not easy to find on the used market. If I were a better mechanic, the choices would be wider.",
        "Wise words, 1,87m tall and looking into both of those, both really nice and fast enough. Most important is trying them out. Want it for the weekend and just for cruising or maybe for the commute to work in the summer. Thanks for your thoughts and the comparison, it helps a lot, have a nice weekend.",
        "METEOR;  With footpegs so far in front it is difficult to  rise up on them. So every bump and pothole shock travels up you spine \u2013 \r\nIt can be quite useful to have ability to stand upon pegs even on road bikes.   Speedbumps , dramatic difference.   And the toe heel shifter fels flimsy. Just tried the Metor in Oslo dealer. My problem is Interceptor or Classic 350 as bike nbr two. .",
        "Hi Stu\nI tested both today. I went with the Meteor in mind, but for some reason my back ached when riding it. I had a similar issue with my Vulcan S until I adjusted the pegs and handlebars. I asked what the position was like on the Classic and Ian (CooperB in between Wellingborough and Milton Keynes - seriously couldn\u2019t be more accommodating) said take it out and find out. So I did. I actually much preferred the ride of the Classic. I did find the handling more nimble. I found the Meteor needed more effort to turn it. Thinking over the weekend but suspect will go for the Classic in Halcyon Green.\nRegards",
        "You are a fine writer Mr. Fillingham. Both bike are good looking,  but the Classic is by far my favorite. I WILL have the Halcyon Green when it comes to the \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8.",

It was a Honda CB 125 in 1981 0r 82 and it was a driving test examiner in t'East Riding. \"Well, you're not very good, but I'm going to pass you,\" he said. \"You're like a great elephant on that thing. Go and get a bigger bike.\" I had a Bonnie three weeks later.",
        "Another great vid. I still have my Boulevard S40 and am still looking for the right Enfield. I'm still on the fence but leaning ever so slightly toward the Classic, if for no other reason, heritage. As for the S40, I have to say it seems to attract similar mindsets. At a recent \"cars and coffee\" (very informal local car/bike \"show\"), as well as at work, the S40 manages to steal attention from the Indian and Harley behemoths. Many of those attracted to the S40 are also Enfield fans. Some I've talked to also watch your channel. Two Wheels Down!",

They have evolved during the years and I must say the latest  models have made it so much easy to ride on for hours together. Great video and keep it rolling.",
        "Hi Stuart,\n\nIn terms of equipment - they BOTH have also USB chargers! (I found out this by reading manual few days after purchase and even dealer was suprised when I showed him the next day! so in case you didn't notice look under the cluch lever!)",
        "I have had the 2021 meteor for a year now. Exceptional bike. I will admit that had the Classic been available, I would have purchased it. Still, I do love the look, feel and comfort of the meteor.",

Looked at a few bikes and even my wife said I looked most comfortable on the Meteor with a smile on my face. Also loved the T120 but you can buy three Meteors for the price ffs!",

        "I own  the meteor,  struck the right chords,  always wanted to own a cruiser style bike. I had the thunderbird twin spark 350, but once I saw this I just had to get it. The only bad thing about it is its top end performance. I use it for my daily commute of  up to 80 km/ day and its really comfortable.\nThe turn by turn navigator is not so great, and  it seams they will stop offering it as standard now onwards.",
        "Nice review Stuart. I would like to comment one point I wished you talked about on this video, it\u2019s about the specific gear pedal on the Meteor. I tried both Meteor and Classic at the dealer last week.  Although I much prefer the Meteor for all the aspects you mentioned, I was really disappointed by the double heel/toe gear pedal on the Meteor. Gears changed unpredictably as my foot was standing on the peg. I find the quality of this gear pedal quite poor, having noticed after my trial that it was a little bit Bent on the toe side. Then I tried the Classic and felt much more comfortable with the gear pedal and driving more a normal motorcycle. I wish RE can solve this particular problem quickly, but I think I made my mind buying the Classic mostly now. Thanks Stuart \ud83d\udc4d",
        "A 64 c200 has been my daily ride for the past 2 years( with a 125 pit bike engine) I love it, took a test ride on a meteor on Tuesday, instantly bought one , just clocked 300 miles and it's a big yes from me after 50 yrs of riding all sorts of bikes, test one ASAP.",

        "Thank you, Stuart; an excellent comparison, well-considered as always. Like many others, I will be interested to hear your thoughts on the Classic 350 vis-a-vis the 500 Bullet, as the latter is still available here in Philippines. I very much like the looks and concept of the 350, however the expressways here have a 400cc minimum, making the ride to somewhere like Subic Bay considerably less enjoyable. On the regular roads one has to contend with wayward livestock, dogs, chooks and kiddies as well as errant bikes, trikes, cars and jeepneys, all driven oblivious to rules or other road-users and firmly of the belief that the Almighty will protect them. The expressway route minimises those interesting... distractions.",
        "The comparison between the Meteor and 1980s Factory Customs is spot on. True to say that in the UK the genre didn't really catch on (the climate is hardly Southern California) but I wouldn't mind betting that in the Bollywood-esque macho testosterone-fuelled Indian market it's a massive success. I was lucky enough to work for a few months in India in the late 2000s and the Enfield owners there were  proud as punch of their bikes and loved showing them off. So maybe the Meteor isn't perfect for the English market, but on its home turf I bet it's a roaring success.",

        "Would love to hear your thought between the Classic 350 2022 vs Benelli Imperiale 350 vs Meteor 350. Which one is the better one out of the 3?",
        "Ive looked at the Meteor, sat on it, wasn't exactly taken with it, chatted to a chap whose just traded his 09 Triumph Bonneville for one? Then I saw the new classic. As I have previously test ridden the Interceptor I am now spoilt for choice. \nThere's something that niggles me about these bikes, they have the looks and timeless style but in my mind, the compromise in BHP between the 650 and 350 is rather a large gulf, you just have to have both, or will there be another 500 to choose from lol.\nKeep up the videos, its good to hear an independent view.",
        "The heel kick down on the Meteor is great tool, dont know why other bikes dont have them. Surprisingly not mentioned ? \ud83d\ude0a",
        "Good morning Uncle Stu, great comparison,  I have enough polishing and cleaning to do on my Interceptor so I'm torn between the Classic 350 Halcyon green or the Classic 350 Dark in the gunmetal grey to avoid all the polishing , although in winter I could do what I do with my Interceptor and give it a couple of coats of Bilt hamber wax before winter! \ud83e\udd14 decisions decisions \ud83d\ude06",
        "Am gonna go see them all and sit on them. I havent ruled out any Royal enfield but am leaning towards the classic. (No.1 spot, Interceptor 2)",
        "Here's an idea  can you do a comparison on the royal enfield classic 350 and the Honda cb 350?",
        "My situation is this: I like the classic 350 better, clearly; but my idea is, in addition to using it daily in the city, also traveling medium and long distances. Regarding the latter; Will the meteor be decisively more comfortable or not? Thanks for the video!, greetings from Argentina!",
        "My favorite choice classic 350cc",
        "Id say as a young guy something like the meteor in the Enfield range would be better for him.\nI ride the classic for the nostalgic feel and bike soul \n Im 69 and got all the head down ass up riding out of my system 50years ago along with the big cruiser .\nLast bike? a Kawasaki 900.",
        "Is there a significant difference between classic 350 from 2021 and 2022? What about the meteor?",
        "I would assume that since the Classic has spoked wheels and needs tubes, I would get the Meteor. Everything else being equal, more or less. Thanks for sharing.",
        "\"The Classic on the other hand is going to require a relentless and fastidious cleaning and protection program to protect it from your average British Winter\". I need to review your video from about a year ago. I don't want to see chrome peeling off my new red / chrome 350. Is there a particular preservative for the chrome?",
        "Excellent analysis and explanation! I've been waiting for the Classic to arrive in showrooms in the USA because the style calls to me more. There was a Meteor in brown (my favorite of their color selection) that came up used and I thought I would get it if the price was right. I'm still holding out for the Classic if another bike doesn't steal my heart first.",
        "the Susuki dealership here in Bolton only had the one demanstrater the Meteor thats one comfy bike but the classic due to supply problems was,nt available for test rides you just had to buy it and hope you made the right choice , well I could,nt deicide so opted for a completly differant bike",
        "The Meteor looks a lot like the early 1970's Ducati scrambler singles with the wide case engines,",
        "Hi there Stuart, \nI really like both, the meteor, and the Classic.\nFrom what I can see on the classic access to the rear shock adjusters looks tricky, where the meteor is more exposed. Should the need arise to change rear shocks, it seems to me it would be an issue. \nAny thoughts?",
        "17:42... service intervals. I own neither bike, but plan to do so. I emailed the US dealership I plan to buy from, to ask about it. The response I got: for ALL Royal Enfield models: 300 mile 1st service, then every 3000 miles. Uhm ...",
        "seriously no gear indicator on a bike in 2022?",
        "The 3000/6000 mile (approx 5000/10,000 km) confusion I believe comes form the manual specifying minor services every 3000 miles/5,000km. These don't require oil changes or valve clearance checks, but at least when I spoke to RE for the Australian market it was necessary to have these completed by a licensed mechanic in order to maintain warranty. I found the best approach was to throw the 865cc kit and stop worrying about that pesky warranty all together.",
        "Nice one Stuart, I think the meteor is more appealing to the younger end of the market and the classic more for the older rider, tough decision though...",
        "My classic 350 manual states after the 300- and 3000-mile break in services, valve and oil service every 6000 miles after that. Even if you don't own it yet, you can download the owner's manual from RE America and see the maintenance schedule for yourself.",
        "We have been discussing this for over 3 years now Jules I'm not getting into it here. Please yourself what you do!",
        "I'm 6'3\" inches tall. I don't care what I look like on a bike, but I do care that I can control it safely and not be uncomfortable on it. Historically I've had to buy a lot of taller seats and seat covers to adjust my sitting position on my bikes. I've also had to install forward mounted foot controls a few times. Like you, nobody has ever said that I look too big for a bike I'm riding, and who cares anyway?",
        "Hi Stuart, love the video and great comparison.  I had a difficult time deciding between the meteor and the classic.  For me the classic felt more comfortable than the meteor with its forward pegs.  But, my heart decided!  I think the Classic has a richer exhaust note, even though they are essentailly the same engine, etc.",
        "For me it was the MZ silverstar 500 or Royal Enfield 350 classic....but finally decided on 3 wheel Piaggio MP3 uban for cost to buy secound hand. Its a scooter but licence class might be A2 which i not have a licence for only a motorbike A class.",
        "She sounded nice comin past the school in With, i do like that rumble, had i not got my ceptor this would be a nice bike ,stuart have you ever had a problem (ceptor 650 euro 5) with the ignition barrel with the key in! not coming on sometimes? i have to switch on off on off a few times i have same colour as you, last julys model and ive had this happening for the past three weeks, regards Charlie from With.",
        "Very Balanced and spot on. Ive just been told by dealer that there is a 3000 mile service but to me it looks more like an owners inspection. \nIve  already done nearly 4000 miles on my new classic  in just two months  so will ask them to do the 6000 mile service instead. \nAnyone  else got what sounds like cam chain rattle when hot?  could be tappets also !",
        "No contest for me.\nClassic all the way.",
        "Genuine review and good video dear Stuart Sir",
        "I like your content not just for the bikes. Personally I am and always been an \"enduro\" rider. But you take on tings, topics and philosophy brought me here. Not always agree but that is precisely the point. \np.s. Big point for the Meteor is the 'toe-heel' shifter.",
        "Hello here is a new rich in advice ans wisdom.I already chosen the classic.I will follow your advice for the break-in,because your philosophy is close to mine and unlike you have no experience in Royal Enfield.I look forward to next videos on the classic.I hope the translator ins't talking too musch nonsense.\ud83d\udc4d\u270c\ufe0f\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf5",
        "i am on the edge of giving up my Harley Sportster XL1200c for a RE 350 classic... I must be crazy.",
        "The most foolish commentary I\u2019ve ever seen regarding motorcycles is whether they \u201clook too small\u201d for a given person. I\u2019m 6\u2019-2\u201d, 240lbs in shorts, and have never given a second thought to this idea.  I generally prefer smaller bikes, seriously considering a Classic 350 in the near future, and I absolutely don\u2019t care what others think about what I\u2019ll look like riding it.  Thank you for reminding your viewers that buying a bike to make YOURSELF happy is the most important consideration. Who cares what others think? I certainly don\u2019t.",
        "It\u2019s your money and your bike! Well said!",
        "The Meteor looks very plain and basic. It\u2019s the one I\u2019d get if I wanted to customize it.  I visualize it with  a single seat and some lower bars turning it into a little city bobber. Or it\u2019s the one to get if you aren\u2019t concerned about looks but want something very practical to commute on every day rain or shine. Add a luggage rack and windshield and it good to go for a little commuter.  The Classic comes with a look that I wouldn\u2019t want to change much. Maybe an accessory or 2 but I\u2019d want to keep it the way it is. It\u2019s the one to keep in the garage and shined up for weekend jaunts, conversations and attention.",
        "Good morning, uncle stew. Good review, as always. Just a question for your crystal ball; what do you think? Will there be another new, 500 cc classic in the near future \ud83d\ude01? Kind regards Kobus the Netherlands \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4b.",
        "Hi, been checking Royal Enfield's official website for different countries. In the UK & Germany for example the classic 350 is more expensive than the meteor but in the USA they are a similar price. In India the Meteor is more expensive than the classic and I've checked that they both have abs etc.\nAre Royal Enfield hiking up the price of the classic in Europe because of it's perceived 'classic/retro/heritage' appearance when in fact it's the cheaper bike to manufacture and has slightly less equipment.\nI'm not talking about the Bullet which is an awful lot cheaper and can be had in a much more basic spec.\nWhy the price hike on the Classic, are we being taken advantage of? India is the largest market so they're not going to sell it at a loss on the domestic market are they? \nWhat do you think?",
        "Stu, I am not sure why there is no tripper navigation in your classic 350. In India it is by default to your variant.",
        "Brilliant video as always Stuart and I love the look of the classic, but I\u2019m tempted by the upcoming BSA \ud83e\udd14",
        "This will be a little controversial since it is a matter of personal preference - for me, the Classic 350, despite its stunning looks which I fell in love with, is a consequent concept where all the pieces of the puzzle fit together perfectly. It looks vintage, it has an okay-ish suspension and brakes, it is slow and that's exactly what you would expect it to be. I would even say it would be awkward if the bike had 100BHP and Brembo Monoblocks screwed to a high-end fork. The Meteor is a different animal. It's a cruiser and that bike concept's fundament is a hefty machine having a high capacity engine with tons of torque which turns the Meteor into an underwhelming wanna-be-Harley. Having seriously fast bikes in my garage I'm perfectly fine with the Classic 350's performance and I enjoy it every time I ride it. It's a Bullet and it performs as a Bullet should. When I rode the Meteor the only thing I could think of was that something was missing and the bike was too small in all regards: size, engine, power, torque,....",
        "Yes your right! most RE dealers are not very bright!",
        "@stuartfillingham\u00a0 Thanks Stuart, that\u2019s good to know. I\u2019ll get that 2000 miles more on her:):):)",
        "Mines very quiet at the moment but these bike have traditional locknut tappets so that could be what your hearing. just insist they are checked/adjusted at your next service. noisy tappets are not an issue to worry about on the REs.",
        "I like the Meteor. I saw a video of the heel shifter and it looked a little sloppy at the pinned connections, like it was missing some bushes.",
        "The toe-heel shifter for the re-born is now on ebay",
        "But the Meteor has exactly the same engine, plus more leg room with its forward pegs.",
        "So...will the classic chrome 500 be surplus to requirements or, even though the classic 350 looks similar,  are they different bikes?",
        "Think the Classic will seriously dent the Meteor sales, as you say a personal choice but the Classic to my eyes is a slightly more  cohesive design, with nothing that looks awkward or slightly jarring to the eyes.",
        "Leaning towards the classic as there are too many blacked out bits on the Meteor. Of course, i don't have a choice in the US.",
        "When I do get my 350, it will be the meteor. Mainly because of the blacked out finish.",
        "New people watch your chain and the slack and learn how to adjust\nIt's very important very",
        "can they both be fitted with a rack,",
        "Test rode the classic today coming off my 1995 250cc single Kawasaki Estrella (basically an homage to the bullet)\u2026..waiting time is at least 6 months and with the exchange rate (yen) dropping, prices will be going up by 10% if ordered next month\u2026..jeez, do I pull the trigger and wait 6 months pottering around on my 250 kawasaki bullet homage while I wait, or not buy and save my money\u2026\u2026oh gosh\u2026.",
        "Stuart as a new rider I tend to edge towards the Classic model . Can I ask , as my wife has hinted she may want to ride pillion occasionally , how would the bike do you think cope with a passenger with its relatively low power ?",
        "An Ex Triumph 1200cc Bobber Black owner here, I loved the Bike but at nearly 70 it became too much of  Bike for me, that's why the RE 350 Meteor will replace.",
        "Great review Stu. I bought the Meteor and had the misfortune of taking the wife to the dealer. I was ready to by the Fireball, but she liked the Super Nova. Now it's arrived there's a problem. We are two portly pensioners and it's so tight two up my nuts are on the tank. So now it's a solo machine. One other problem. For some strange reason they only make a hard pannier for one side of the bike. Not sure the Classic has the same problem.",
        "My question is whether or not either one will haul my 300 plus pounds to 70mph.",
        "that's a nice road were is it",
        "I am 6 ft height. Is it comfortable for me ?",
        "Hi Mr. Stuart! I follow your v\u00eddeos and they are very good. Can you help me making a decision? I want to buy my first bike and i like the classic 350 and the interceptor 650. The classic is lovely and more cheap but i like to travel with my spouse and i'm afraid it has low power to take us and the bagage for longer rides and climbs. On other hand,  the interceptor has that power but is 2000 euros more expensive. My doubt is if the difference on money is worth it.\nThank you for your attention and keep the good job",
        "It will be fine, just not fast!",
        "It's because the Indian passenger sits side saddle..",
        "@christopherspick5111\u00a0 Cheers, that makes sense.",
        "Well, I'm not Uncle Stu, but if you're covering more miles and carrying a pillion, you should go with the 650. The only problem you  have with the Interceptor is where the pillion foot rests are located. Due to the sweep of the exhaust, they're set pretty high, so the pillion ends up in a more crouched position than seated. That can get pretty uncomfortable, and in a pretty short amount of time. You can relocate the footrests (I believe there are even kits available), but the pillion might want to wear pants that won't melt if they come into contact with the pipes.",
        "U can go for classic reborn",
        "Well that was no help! Still prefer the look of the classic but the riding position of the Meteor! \ud83e\udd14",
        "Uncle Stu you nailed it \nFell in love with the Classic last year when it came out in India only to be told by dealers it would never come in the country \nWe have the meteor !!!!! \nSo brought a interceptor but then came the classic just done a straight swop best thing I done it\u2019s awesome",
        "I own a Meteor 350. I love riding it over a weekend at a reasonable speed ! I know it\u2019s not one of the fastest though.",
        "Rear mudguard and tail lamp in the new classic doesn't look good compared to older classic. I have classic 350 uce and love it.",
        "Well, I'm on the waiting list for the Signal Classic... yipeee... the Signal Classic here in the states seems to be more popular than the solid colored ones but I'm sure they will sell. My dealership here cannot keep any of the Royal Enfields in stock but they have a ton of Triumphs all over the showroom floor. But I guess that's to be expected when you are asking for a premium price but due to the current economic situation more people are looking at the price as well as gas price.",
        "Stuart , you said he westerners are taught to be careful with our money ..you mean Yorkshire persons surely .\ud83d\ude01",
        "The size of the bike matters in terms of its comfort. The reason I will never buy a cruiser.",

        "As long as it's not electric, or made in china, you're good....",
        "Honest review. It's just a bad bad. Very bad looking bike. Classic forcefully made to look like a cruiser. Also big ugly looking tank. Superb meteor is much much much better.",
