        "Absolutely agree with you. We all can't own 2 or 3 bikes. So we need that one bike which will serve almost all aspects. Currently own a meteor 350. It almost can do all, just not too much off-road. Maybe next time when I will change it, I may go with a Himalayan type bike, which can also serve me well, including off-roading.",
        "This is so important to realize  and no one is putting up such valuable thoughts. \nYou give us very important perspectives. \nI myself started thinking so differently for my motorcycle and trust me it's only because of you. \nThank you so much Sir\u2764",

Currently have an R15, so need a powerful bike. \n3. Not willing to spend too much for service and spares like say 10k or more per year. \n4. Reliability is Top most priority.

In my access the max the scooty can go upto 75 - 80 kmph. And thats also dancing all the way because of the suspension. So good luck to your body after the ride.

It saddens me deeply to even think about replacing it. I wish there was a way to make pillion seat more comfortable. I know asking for a adjustable suspension is too much and will take away the spirit of bike but a comfortable pillion seat please.\n\nThanks Shumi and @motorinc.

Now at present mileage gives 25 km per liter. I feel very bad. Speaking to the service center, their response is very bad. If you want to say, BS six face 2 all bikes, scooters are having such problems. I feel really bad. Can you please give me a solution. I always ride in economy zone and I always maintain my tyre pressure.",
